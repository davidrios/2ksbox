/*
 * voodoo2.c -- the 3dfx Voodoo 2 as a QEMU PCI device (doc 21, M14).
 *
 * The chip is 86Box's emulation, vendored verbatim under 86box/ and built
 * against the shim of 86Box's platform headers under shim/ (voodoo_shim.c
 * is the shim's other half). This file is what QEMU sees: a PCI function
 * 121a:0002 with one 16 MiB memory BAR whose accesses go to 86Box's
 * register/LFB/texture handlers, the configuration bytes 86Box owns
 * (initEnable at 0x40) forwarded to its handlers, and the display half --
 * a Voodoo 1/2 is a pass-through card, so when the guest sets fbiInit0's
 * VGA_PASS bit the guest console stops being drawn by the VGA device and
 * every frame the Voodoo's display timer completes is copied into it.
 * Screendumps, the VNC fallback and the player's own surface path all see
 * that frame the way they see a VGA one.
 *
 *   -device voodoo2[,fbmem=2|4][,texmem=2|4][,threads=1|2|4]
 *                  [,bilinear=on|off][,dither-sub=on|off][,filter=on|off]
 *                  [,undither=on|off]
 *                  [,recompiler=on|off][,ramfifo=on|off][,lfb-order=on|off]
 *
 * lfb-order (off): also wait for the ring before an LFB or texture write.
 * The other half of that ordering -- waiting for 86Box's own FIFO before the
 * ring's next packets, which is the one a game meets -- is unconditional.
 * See "one order" below.
 *
 * ramfifo (on by default): the command-FIFO ring is plain RAM to the guest,
 * so Glide's packet stream is ordinary stores instead of one MMIO trap per
 * dword -- and under TCG a trap mid-block is a cpu_io_recompile, which was
 * most of the vCPU's time in Quake II (doc 21 §9). The chip learns what was
 * written at the guest's next access to anything else on the card; see
 * voodoo2_fifo_sync().
 *
 * Threads: the guest's MMIO writes run on the vCPU thread with the BQL; the
 * display timer on the main loop with the BQL (86Box has both on its CPU
 * thread, which is the invariant that matters); the FIFO thread and the
 * render threads are 86Box's own and touch nothing of QEMU's.

/* -------------------------------------------------- the command FIFO in RAM
 *
 * With the ring as RAM the device sees none of the guest's packet writes,
 * and 3dfx's Glide tells the chip nothing either: it leaves hole counting
 * on (cvg/init/util.c), i.e. the chip executes whatever it has seen written
 * contiguously from its read pointer. So the device finds out itself, at
 * the guest's next access to anything else on the card -- a status poll, a
 * register, the LFB -- and what it counts is **words, not packets**: as
 * many as the guest has written from the last one counted on, which go to
 * 86Box's consumer as the depth the per-dword writes used to add. The
 * consumer then parses them and blocks inside a packet whose rest has not
 * arrived, which is what the chip does.
 *
 * It counted whole packets once, on the header's word count. Glide does
 * write each packet whole before it touches the card again -- the 5 s line
 * counts the ones met half-written, and the count stays at 0 -- so counting
 * words changes nothing in practice; it is what the chip does, and one
 * assumption fewer between a guest and a hang (2026-09-17).
 *
 * Where the guest has not written yet is told by poison: a word the
 * consumer has taken is set to VOODOO2_FIFO_POISON before the guest can
 * learn that its slot is free -- the only way it learns that is reading
 * cmdFifoRdPtr, and that read is answered here, after the poisoning, with
 * the pointer it poisoned up to. The value is one no guest writes (see the
 * define), because a poison word that a guest could also mean as data stops
 * the FIFO on the guest's own bytes; a word that still reads as poison is
 * taken as written anyway when a word close after it is, since the guest
 * fills the ring in address order. A packet this cannot follow (a JSR, AGP,
 * a Banshee type) is warned about once and the window goes back to MMIO;
 * ramfifo=off is the A/B.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- one order
 *
 * The chip has one way in from the PCI bus: a packet in the command FIFO, a
 * write into the LFB or texture aperture, and a register write all reach it
 * in the order the guest made them. 86Box has two queues -- `voodoo->fifo`,
 * where a frame-buffer or texture write is queued, and the ring -- and its
 * thread empties the whole of the first before it looks at the second
 * (`vid_voodoo_fifo.c`); a register the vCPU thread writes here does not
 * queue at all. So the ring is the stream that can be overtaken.
 *
 * **That is what hangs a guest at the end, and it is measured.** Glide's
 * grSstWinClose writes its last packets and then clears fbiInit7's
 * command-FIFO bit. The register write lands at once while the ring is
 * still being consumed, and 86Box's consumer loop ends the moment
 * `cmdfifo_enabled` goes false, so whatever it had not reached is never run
 * -- and `SST_status`'s busy bit is `cmdfifo_depth_rd != cmdfifo_depth_wr`,
 * so the card reads busy to every later poll. That poll is Glide's own
 * grSstIdle. Carmageddon's 3dfx build hung there on 2026-09-18 with two
 * words outstanding of the 104 the last walk counted, the card otherwise
 * entirely idle: `busy: 0 cmds outstanding (wr 49668 rd 49668), fifo depth
 * 59495109/59495111`, and 27 million reads of register 0x000 in five
 * seconds. So a write that reconfigures the FIFO runs the ring out first,
 * always; the teardown phase of tools/voodoo-guest-test.py is the check.
 *
 * **And the other direction is the flashing HUD.** What the guest wrote
 * through the LFB *before* a batch of packets has to be on the card before
 * they are, and 86Box's thread empties its MMIO queue only between passes
 * over the ring -- which in a race never empties: measured ~19,000 words
 * behind, every 5 s line of Carmageddon's race. So the HUD the game writes
 * with grLfbWriteRegion sits in that queue while the swap that follows it in
 * the ring is consumed, and lands in the buffer the swap has just turned
 * into the back one: a frame late, or not at all. The user's screenshots say
 * it exactly -- the panels Carmageddon draws as geometry are there in both,
 * and the sprites it writes through the LFB are in one and gone in the next.
 * voodoo2_mmio_drain() is at the ring's publish point for that, and it is
 * the ordering that matters, so it is unconditional.
 *
 * **What `lfb-order` (off) adds** is the mirror of it: a wait for the ring
 * before an LFB or texture write, so a packet already counted is drawn
 * first. That window is only as wide as the consumer's wake, and the
 * ordering phase of the guest test measures it away on an unloaded host --
 * the block lands on top with the switch either way -- so it is kept as the
 * A/B rather than turned on, because it costs a wait for the rasterizer at
 * every ring-then-LFB turn. The 5 s line counts both kinds of wait.

 * never returns. Measured 2026-09-19 on `ramfifo=off`: Carmageddon froze on
 * its first race frame with `wr 3243 rd 3242`, one command outstanding, the
 * ring caught up (`fifo depth 631660/631660`), nothing rendering, and the
 * guest reading register 0x000 26 million times in five seconds.
 *
 * So: when the guest is polling status and every *real* sign of work is
 * clear -- both FIFOs empty, the ring caught up, no render thread, no swap
 * pending, the consumer not in its loop -- the difference is stale and is
 * put back. The hysteresis is what makes it safe: the consumer is briefly
 * between dequeueing a command and counting it, and in that window the card
