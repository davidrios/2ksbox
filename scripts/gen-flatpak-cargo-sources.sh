# Regenerate packaging/flatpak/cargo-sources.json from Cargo.lock.
#
# Flathub builds have no network, so the Flatpak cannot let cargo fetch
# crates: every one has to be a declared source with a checksum, which is
# what this file is (every crate + its .cargo-checksum.json + the cargo
# config that redirects crates-io at the vendor directory).
#
# **Two lock files, one vendor directory.** `launcher-qt/` declares its own
# cargo workspace (ADR-015) and it is the launcher the Flatpak installs, so
# its crates have to be declared too. The generator takes one lock file at
# a time, so it is run once per lock and the results are merged on their
# `dest`: the two share most of their crates at identical versions, and one
# `cargo/config` covers both because `CARGO_HOME` is the same for both
# builds.
#
# The root lock file still names `launcher/`'s egui crates: the Flatpak no
# longer builds that front end (ADR-015), so they are vendored and never
# compiled. That costs a download and not a build, and dropping them would
# mean generating from something other than the lock file — which is the
# one thing here that is exact.
#
# Run it after any dependency change in either workspace, and commit the
# result:
#   scripts/gen-flatpak-cargo-sources.sh
#
# The generator is upstream's (flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools, MIT), pinned
# to a commit and checked against its hash rather than trusted from a
# moving branch — it is a script this repo executes. It needs aiohttp and
# tomlkit, supplied by uv so nothing is installed on the host.
