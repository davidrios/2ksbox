#
# Usage: scripts/configure-qemu.sh [--windows] [extra configure flags...]
#
# --windows cross-compiles for Windows x86_64 with mingw-w64 into
# build/win/qemu instead of build/qemu, against the Rust staticlib built
# for x86_64-pc-windows-gnu. Run it inside the cross container
# (scripts/win-cross.sh), which has the mingw glib/pixman/epoxy the build
# needs (docs/build-windows.md). The two build
# directories are independent, so one checkout holds a Linux build and a
# Windows build at once.
#
# On an Apple Silicon Mac the Intel build (scripts/build.sh --x86_64,
# docs/build-macos.md "The Intel build") runs this whole script under
# Rosetta, and that is how it is recognised (sysctl.proc_translated): it
# configures into build/x86_64/qemu against the Rust staticlibs built for
# x86_64-apple-darwin, with the Intel Homebrew's Python, so uname, the
# compiler and meson all answer x86_64 without being told. On an Intel Mac
# nothing runs translated and the build is the plain native one.
#
# On Windows itself, in MSYS2's MINGW64 shell, the same build is native
# (docs/build-windows.md, "Building on Windows"): --windows is implied, no
# cross prefix, and MSYS2's own Python rather than uv's. A python.org
# interpreter makes a venv with `Scripts\` where QEMU's configure looks for
# `bin/`.
#
# QEMU_PYTHON=<interpreter> uses that one and never consults uv. It is for
# a sandbox that has a suitable Python and cannot fetch one (the Flatpak:
# no uv in the SDK, no network during the build). Its version is checked,
# because the failure is obscure where it bites. QEMU 9.2's mkvenv
# supports 3.8-3.13, and 3.14 works only with the real `distlib`
# installed, since pip >= 26 trimmed the vendored copy mkvenv falls back
# to (3.14 with distlib configures and builds; MSYS2 has no older Python).

# No QEMU user interface at all. The player is the front end. It embeds
# QEMU, the embed library appends `-display none` itself
# (embed/libqemu_embed.c), and it brings its own 3D context provider
# (patch 30) and audio backend (patch 20). Every display QEMU can build was
# dead code each packager still had to carry: SDL2 (and, through
# sdl2-compat, SDL3) beside the player on Windows and macOS, GTK and its
# pango/cairo/gdk chain in libqemu-embed on Linux, spice's server, curses.
# Turning them off costs nothing we use and takes ~40 libraries off the
# Linux embed library alone.
#
# VNC stays. It needs no toolkit, and it is the only way left to *look at*
# a guest under a hand-run `qemu-system-i386`. With no local display
# compiled in and no `-display` given, `qemu_setup_display()` starts a VNC
# server on localhost:5900 (system/vl.c). Anything scripted passes
# `-display none` and gets neither.
#
# The host audio backends go for the same reason. The player's audio is
# patch 20's `embed` audiodev, an SPSC ring the embedding application owns
# (docs/11); every machine the launcher writes says `audiodev=embed0`, and
# every headless tool says `audiodev=none`. ALSA, PulseAudio, PipeWire,
# JACK, OSS, sndio, CoreAudio and DirectSound were compiled in and linked,
# and none was ever opened. `none` and `wav` are built unconditionally
# (audio/meson.build) and `embed` is ours, so what the tree uses is
# untouched. `tools/xp-cdimage-test.sh` still captures CD-DA through
# `-audiodev wav`.
#
# This is *not* `--audio-drv-list=`. That list only sets the default
# priority order; the per-driver feature options below, auto-detected,
# are what pull the libraries in.
#
# The same goes for the rest of QEMU's optional features that no machine
# the launcher writes can reach. Networking: every bundle says `-netdev
# user` and nothing else, so slirp stays and AF_XDP and vde go. So does
# libbpf, whose one consumer is `hw/net/virtio-net.c`'s eBPF RSS steering,
# a device the launcher never writes (pcnet on 98, rtl8139 on XP). Block:
# every drive is a local file (a qcow2, a raw floppy or one of doc 17's
# disc images through our own `cdimage` driver), so the network-storage
# drivers go. curl and libssh go because this host has them, and
# iscsi/nfs/rbd/gluster/blkio are *pinned off* because another host might.
# Auto-detection makes the build depend on which libraries the machine
# happened to have, which is how the Flatpak and the Mac would end up with
# a different libqemu-embed from this box's. brlapi is a braille chardev
# nothing here opens. libpng and libjpeg go too: the one PNG QEMU can
# write is `screendump`'s `format: png`, and every tool here takes the
# PPM and converts it itself (tools/qmpc.py), while VNC's JPEG encoding
# serves a viewer nothing scripted opens. Both were two more libraries in
# every package for nothing.
