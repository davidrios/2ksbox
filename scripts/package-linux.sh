# Build the Linux package (install layout in doc 07). Stage everything a

#   scripts/package-linux.sh                 # build, stage, check, tar
#   scripts/package-linux.sh --no-build      # use target/release as it is

#   scripts/package-linux.sh --out DIR       # default build/package
#   scripts/package-linux.sh --prefix DIR    # stage straight into DIR
#
# `--prefix` stages the layout straight into an existing prefix instead of
# a versioned subdirectory, and rolls no tarball. The Flatpak
# (packaging/flatpak/) fills `/app` this way, since an install prefix and
# the staged tree have the same shape. It never deletes the destination.
#
# It does not build QEMU. build/qemu (libqemu-embed-i386.so + qemu-img)
# and qemu/pc-bios must already be there (scripts/build.sh). The
# guest-tools ISO is included when guest-tools/out has one.
#
# The launcher is `launcher-qt`, the Qt 6 / QML front end over
# `launcher-core` (ADR-015). Qt itself is not in the tarball. It is
# ~38 MB of shared libraries, QML modules and plugins that every
# distribution packages, and a bundled copy would still have to match the
# host's Wayland, OpenGL and fontconfig stacks. So the package depends on
# the system's `qt6-base` + `qt6-declarative` (+ `qt6-quickcontrols2`),
# and the check below lists what the staged launcher resolves. For a host
# with no Qt 6 there is the Flatpak, which gets Qt from `org.kde.Platform`.
#
# The layout, relative to the tree's root (= an install prefix):
#   bin/2ksbox                        the launcher (Qt 6, ADR-015)
#   bin/2ksbox-player                 the player
#   lib/2ksbox/libqemu-embed-i386.so
#   lib/2ksbox/libd3dpt_exec.so       the Direct3D executor and the DXVK
#   lib/2ksbox/libdxvk_d3d9.so.0        it runs on (both or neither)
#   lib/2ksbox/libd3dpt_exec_remote.so  the executor in another process, on
#   lib/2ksbox/wine/d3dpt_exec.dll        Wine (ADR-018). QEMU opens the .so
#   lib/2ksbox/wine/d3dpt-exec-host.exe   below the Vulkan floor, and it runs
#                                         the .dll/.exe pair there. All three
#                                         or none; the package ships no Wine
#   libexec/2ksbox/qemu-img           ours, patched, kept off PATH
#   share/2ksbox/pc-bios/             QEMU firmware (the player's -L)
#   share/2ksbox/guest-tools/         the guest-tools ISO
#   share/2ksbox/shaders/             presets, with --with-shaders
#   share/2ksbox/desktop/             .desktop + AppStream, for install.sh
#   share/icons/hicolor/<n>x<n>/apps/ the application icon, at every size
#   share/doc/2ksbox/                 COPYING, notices, README
#   install.sh                        copy the above into a prefix
#
# `2ksbox` is the product (2ksbox.com); `com._2ksbox.Launcher` is the
# application ID the desktop entry, the icon and the Wayland app_id carry.
# A name segment may not start with a digit and flatpak rejects
# `com.2ksbox...`, so the leading digit is escaped, as `7-zip.org` gets
# `org._7zip...`. Everything else carries the product name, including the
# repository, the docs and the user's data directory (moved once by
