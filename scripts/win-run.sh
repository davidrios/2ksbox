#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run the native Windows build from the checkout, in MSYS2's MINGW64
# shell (docs/build-windows.md, "Building on Windows"). A package finds
# everything because it is one folder. A checkout keeps the same files in
# build/win/ and target/, so this script points each program at them.
#
#   scripts/win-run.sh launcher [args...]   the Qt launcher (2ksbox.exe in a package)
#   scripts/win-run.sh player [args...]     the player (2ksbox-player.exe)
#   scripts/win-run.sh qemu [args...]       qemu-system-i386.exe: no window of its
#                                           own, -display vnc=:0 to look at a guest
#   GDB=1 scripts/win-run.sh player ...     any of them under gdb
#
# What it sets, each only when the caller has not:
#   PATH                  build/win/qemu first, for libqemu-embed-i386.dll.
#                         The mingw runtime and Qt come from /mingw64/bin,
#                         already on this shell's PATH
#   LAUNCHER_PLAYER_BIN   the launcher is built into launcher-qt/target/ and
#                         looks beside itself and in target/<profile>, where
#                         a --target build never puts the player
#   D3DPT_EXEC_LIB        QEMU's own search is relative to the working directory
#   D3DPT_DXVK_LIB        the executor loads DXVK only by the package's name for
#                         it, dxvk_d3d9.dll (never plain d3d9.dll, which is
#                         Windows' own), so the build is copied to that name
#
# The launcher is a windowed program and writes nothing to this terminal.
# Its log is %APPDATA%\2ksbox\data\launcher.log, and a machine's is
# player.log beside it.
