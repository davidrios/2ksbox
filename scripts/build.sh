#           (glib, pixman, libslirp, zstd; static) and the launcher's Qt
#           6, built from source for the floor into build/deps/<arch>
#           (docs/build-macos.md, "The libraries"). Elsewhere the
#           distribution's.
#   qemu    prepare-qemu.sh (overlay + patch queue) -> configure-qemu.sh
#           -> ninja: qemu-system-i386, qemu-img, qemu-io,
#           libqemu-embed-i386.{so,dylib}
#   rust    cargo build --release: player, libdisc/discx, launcher-core
#           (with its `launcherx` verb binary), qemu-embed, shader-chain.
#           Runs after `qemu`, because the player links libqemu-embed from
#           build/qemu. Then `cargo check --release --workspace` keeps the
#           one non-default member, `launcher-capi`, compiling.
#   qt      cargo build --release in launcher-qt/ (its own workspace):
#           the Qt 6 / QML launcher that every package ships (ADR-015).
#           Needs Qt 6 development files. Without them the stage is
#           skipped and this host can build no package.
#   dxvk    prepare-dxvk.sh -> configure-dxvk.sh -> ninja
#   exec    build-d3dpt-exec.sh: libd3dpt_exec, the D3D executor. Runs
#           after `dxvk`, whose headers it compiles against.
#   guest   guest-tools/build-wrappers.sh: the guest-tools ISO (it also
#           calls build-driver.sh for the XP display driver)
#
# A stage whose tools are missing is skipped with the reason, or fails if
# it was named on the command line. The summary at the end lists what
# this host built and what it could not.
#
# A partial rebuild is the project's most expensive mistake. A stale
# libd3dpt_exec or guest-tools ISO after a D3DPT_PROTO_VERSION bump reads
# as "the guest will not boot", not as "you forgot a command".
#
# With everything up to date a run takes a couple of seconds thanks to the
# stamps below, and needs no network.
#
# `launcher-qt/` stays its own cargo workspace (ADR-015), so a plain
# `cargo build` at the root never needs Qt 6. The `rust` stage, the test
# suite and a Mac or CI checkout then work on a host with no Qt.
