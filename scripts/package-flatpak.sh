# Build and install the Flatpak (manifest in packaging/flatpak/).
# Everything is compiled inside the SDK, because the host's glibc is newer
# than the runtime's and host-built binaries cannot run in it.
#
# Never run this at the same time as `scripts/build-windows.sh`. Both use
# the one `qemu/` tree. The Windows build re-applies the patch queue while
# flatpak-builder copies the tree into its sandbox, the copy comes out half
# patched, and QEMU's compile fails on a header neither build uses
# (`hw/3dfx/glidept_mm.c: hw/core/sysbus.h: No such file`). Run one, then
# the other.
#
# The runtime is `org.kde.Platform`, because the launcher is Qt 6 / QML
# (ADR-015) and KDE's runtime carries Qt. The first build downloads the
# ~3 GB runtime + SDK pair.
#
#   scripts/package-flatpak.sh              build, install --user, smoke check
#   scripts/package-flatpak.sh --no-install just build into the repo
#   scripts/package-flatpak.sh --no-wine    skip the Wine add-on (below)
#   scripts/package-flatpak.sh --wine-only  only the add-on, onto the installed app
#   scripts/package-flatpak.sh --check      only re-run the smoke check
#
# The Wine add-on (M15 step 7) is a second manifest,
# `com._2ksbox.Launcher.Wine.yml`, built after the app because the app is
# its runtime. Building Wine from source takes about half an hour more.
# The smoke check expects it unless --no-wine was given.
#
# Environment:
#   FLATPAK_USER_DIR    which `--user` installation to use (flatpak's own
#                       variable). Set it if ~/.local/share/flatpak is on
#                       a full filesystem.
#   FLATPAK_BUILD_DIR   where flatpak-builder works, default build/flatpak.
#                       The build tree is several GB (a whole QEMU and a
#                       release Rust workspace), so point it at a disk
#                       with room.
