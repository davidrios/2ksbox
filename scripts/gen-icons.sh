# The master is `packaging/icon/2ksbox.png`, a transparent RGBA render of
# a beige CRT on a 500x500 canvas it does not fill (the drawing is
# 431x436). It is the only file to replace when the icon changes.
# Everything below is derived from it and checked in, because the places
# that consume an icon cannot run ImageMagick:
#
#   * `launcher-qt` embeds one with `include_bytes!` at compile time,
#   * the Flatpak build is offline and installs files, it does not draw them,
#   * the Windows package is cross-built in a container without ImageMagick,
#   * a user running `packaging/linux/install.sh` from a tarball has no
#     build tools at all.
#
# What each size is for (`hicolor` is the freedesktop icon theme's
# directory-per-size layout, which is what a Linux desktop looks in):
#
#   16, 24, 32, 48   task switchers, window decorations, small menus
#   64, 128          the applications menu, GNOME Software's lists
#   256, 512         software-centre banners, macOS, HiDPI everywhere
#   2ksbox.ico       Windows: 16/32/48/256 in one file, which is what a
#                    shortcut and an .exe resource both want
#
# and, under `packaging/windows/Assets/`, the four logos an MSIX manifest
# names (`scripts/package-msix.sh`), at the exact sizes the Store checks:
#
#   Square44x44Logo   44x44    the taskbar, the Start list: the icon whole
#   StoreLogo         50x50    the Store listing and the installer
#   Square150x150Logo 150x150  the Start tile: the icon at three quarters,
#   Wide310x150Logo   310x150  centred, because Windows paints the tile's
#                              background behind it (BackgroundColor)
#
# Nothing is ever scaled *up*. The master is first padded with
# transparency to 512x512, centred, and every size is a downscale of that.
# Padding rather than resizing keeps the drawing at its native size in the
# largest icon. If the artwork is redrawn larger, nothing here changes.
