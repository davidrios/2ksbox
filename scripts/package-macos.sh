#
# How this differs from the Linux package (scripts/package-linux.sh), and
# why it is a second script rather than a switch:
#
# * Nothing may come from outside the bundle. A Linux package relies on
#   the distribution for glib, pixman, zstd and the rest. A Mac has none
#   of them, and the Mac that runs the app has no Homebrew, no XQuartz and
#   no Vulkan. So the script copies in the whole non-system dylib closure
#   and rewrites every install name to @rpath. That is most of the script.
# * `macdeployqt` puts Qt in the app. The launcher is `launcher-qt`
#   (ADR-015), so the bundle needs the Qt frameworks, the cocoa platform
#   plugin and the QtQuick QML module tree. Only the frameworks appear in
#   a load command, so the closure would never find the other two.
#   `macdeployqt` runs first and the closure runs over what it leaves. Our
#   QML is compiled into the binary as a Qt resource, so `-qmldir` points
#   `macdeployqt` at `launcher-qt/qml` to find the imports. Without it the
#   import scanner sees no QML and deploys no modules. The two passes
#   after it prune and rewire what it collects, because it deploys whole
#   plugin categories and QML module trees from Homebrew's shared Qt
#   prefix and leaves stale Homebrew rpaths behind.
# * The bundle is the prefix. `Contents` has the `lib/libexec/share`
#   shape of a Unix prefix, and `launcher_core::paths` finds it by the same
#   `share/2ksbox` marker. `MacOS/` takes the place of `bin/`, because it
#   is the one directory macOS launches an executable from.
# * Signing goes inside-out and the floor is Homebrew's. Every Mach-O is
#   signed before the thing that contains it. The oldest macOS the app
#   runs on is the oldest Homebrew supports (scripts/macos-floor.sh), and
#   scripts/build.sh builds everything of ours for it. The Homebrew
#   libraries copied in are this Mac's bottles, so the ones above the
#   floor are swapped for the floor's builds (scripts/macos-bottles.py).
#   LSMinimumSystemVersion is then measured from what the bundle carries,
#   and any file still above the floor fails the package.
#
# It does not build QEMU, DXVK or the Glide wrapper. Those come from
# `scripts/build.sh`. The script reports anything missing by name instead
# of leaving it out quietly. The three optional companions (Glide, the
# Direct3D executor, Vulkan) are only a warning each, and cost the guest
# one accelerated path.
