# Build the VGA BIOSes 2ksbox ships in place of QEMU's prebuilt ones:
# SeaBIOS's VGA BIOS (qemu/roms/seabios, the version QEMU 9.2.4 pins) with
# our patch queue in patches/seabios/, for the two variants a 2ksbox
# machine loads -- `stdvga` (-vga std, and d3dpt-vga, whose romfile it is)
# and `cirrus`. Output: firmware/vgabios-<variant>.bin, which is checked
# in, because SeaBIOS needs gcc and GNU ld for x86 and neither the Mac
# nor the Flatpak SDK is asked to have them. prepare-qemu.sh copies these
# over qemu/pc-bios/, which is what every package ships.
#
# Rerun after changing a patch in patches/seabios/ and commit the blobs
# with it. Needs a Linux host with gcc that can do -m32 (CROSS_PREFIX=
# x86_64-linux-gnu- on a non-x86 one) and python3. The guest-side proof is
# `VBEPAL=1 tools/vga-dirty-guest-test.py vesa` (the vbe-palette check in
# scripts/test.sh): a rebuild on another compiler is not byte-identical,
# so the check is what the ROM does, not what it hashes to.
