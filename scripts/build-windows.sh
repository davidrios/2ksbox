# Build the Windows artefacts from a Linux host, in dependency order. This
# is the Windows counterpart of scripts/build.sh, which builds for the host
# it runs on. Everything runs inside the cross container
# (scripts/win-cross.sh, packaging/windows/Dockerfile) except the guest
# tools and the packaging step, which run on the host.
#
# In MSYS2's MINGW64 shell on Windows the same stages build natively, for
# debugging on the PC. They use the cross image's compilers, C runtime and
# Rust target, so a native build is the build that ships. The guest-tools
# ISO builds there too, with MSYS2's i686 toolchain
# (guest-tools/msys2-i686.sh). Packaging stays on Linux. Run what was
# built with scripts/win-run.sh.
#
#   scripts/build-windows.sh                everything this host can build
#   scripts/build-windows.sh qemu rust      only those stages
#   scripts/build-windows.sh --package      ... and then roll the zip (Linux)
#   scripts/build-windows.sh --msys2-deps   (Windows) install what the build needs
#
# Stages, in the order they must run:
#
#   qemu    configure-qemu.sh --windows -> ninja: qemu-system-i386.exe,
#           qemu-img.exe, qemu-io.exe, libqemu-embed-i386.dll, into
#           build/win/qemu (with libdisc built for windows-gnu first)
#   rust    cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu: the
#           player, launcher-core, discx. Runs after `qemu`, because the
#           player links the embed DLL from build/win/qemu.
#   qt      cargo build in launcher-qt/ (its own workspace): the Qt 6 /
#           QML launcher that every package ships (ADR-015). Cross-compiled
#           like the rest. The image carries the mingw Qt to link against
#           and a native Qt of the same version for moc, rcc and
#           qmltyperegistrar.
#   exec    DXVK's d3d9.dll into build/win/dxvk (configure-dxvk.sh
#           --windows), then build-d3dpt-exec.sh --windows: d3dpt_exec.dll,
#           the Direct3D executor (doc 14). The package ships DXVK as
#           dxvk_d3d9.dll, the executor's default. D3DPT_D3D9=system (or
#           auto, when DXVK opens no adapter) runs it on Windows' own
#           system32\d3d9.dll instead.
#   guest   guest-tools/build-wrappers.sh: the guest-tools ISO. It is
#           32-bit guest code, the same file the Linux package ships, so
#           a default run builds it only when there is none yet. Naming
#           the stage rebuilds it (after a driver change).
#
# docs/build-windows.md is the prose; docs/tracks/m11-windows-host.md is
# the track. Nothing here writes to build/qemu or target/release, so a
# checkout holds a Linux build and a Windows build side by side.
