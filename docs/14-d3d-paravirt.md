# 14. Paravirtual Direct3D device (ADR-006)

Direct3D 8/9 calls leave the guest as a command stream and run in native
host code: one protocol, one decoder, one executor over four possible
Direct3D 9 libraries. This doc covers the device, the protocol, the guest
DLLs and the executor. The XP display driver's Direct3D DDI (doc 15) and
the Win9x driver's HAL (doc 19) use the same protocol and executor
through a command window in `d3dpt-vga`'s VRAM. Doc 04 has the 3D
strategy as a whole, the M4 and M15 track docs the test loops,
`docs/testing.md` the tools and `docs/development.md` the env knobs.

WineD3D in the guest (a wine9x build once on the guest-tools ISO) was
the older fallback for hosts with no executor; ADR-018 retired it and
M15 step 6 removed it (2026-09-23). Its numbers below are history.

## Why a device and not a better WineD3D

Under TCG every guest instruction costs ~10–20 host instructions. WineD3D
in the guest spends most of a frame translating D3D state into GL state
(shaders, state tables, resource tracking) before anything reaches the
host, then crosses once per GL call. A serializer crosses once per batch
with almost no guest-side work, and the translation runs natively. The
same reasoning made qemu-3dfx pass GL and Glide through instead of
emulating a GPU.

## Shape

```
guest (XP / Win98)                      host (QEMU process)
 game.exe                               d3dpt (SysBus) or d3dpt-vga's window
   └ d3d9.dll (ours, C)  ──batch──▶       └ libd3dpt_exec (dlopened)
   └ d3d8.dll (over d3d9)                     decoder + handle mirror
 shared window: records, data, bulk           └ IDirect3D9: DXVK / system d3d9 /
 FXPTL.SYS / FXMEMMAP.VXD map it                 Wine's d3d9 in a child process
                                          present → embed presenter (doc 12)
```

- **Transport.** The qemu-3dfx model: a SysBus device (`d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_mm.c`,
  patch 40) with a 4 KiB register page at `D3DPT_MM_BASE` (0xdfffe000)
  and a 64 MiB RAM window at `D3DPT_SHM_BASE` (0xd8000000), fixed
  guest-physical addresses mapped through `FXPTL.SYS`'s `\\.\MAPMEM` on
  NT or `FXMEMMAP.VXD` on 9x. On `d3dpt-vga` the window is the top
  `D3DPT_SHM_SIZE` of the VRAM BAR instead (doc 15). The guest writes
  records until a sync point (Present, a Lock readback,
  GetRenderTargetData, a query, device creation) and rings
  `D3DPT_REG_DOORBELL` once. The batch runs synchronously on the vCPU
  thread under the BQL; a decoder thread waits until a measurement asks
  for it.
- **Protocol.** `d3dpt/d3dpt_proto.h` is the one header for guest DLL,
  QEMU device and executor (`D3DPT_PROTO_VERSION`, 17 today). Bump it on
  any wire change and rebuild the executor and the ISO, which do not say
  they are stale; the suite then fails as `protocol mismatch` or a guest
  that never attaches. The guest encoder is `d3dpt/d3dpt_enc.h`. The
  executor validates every record (a hostile guest must not crash the
  host), and a refused batch logs `batch error N at record R (op O)`.
- **Guest `d3d9.dll`** (`guest-tools/src/d3dpt/`): COM objects for
  IDirect3D9, the device, swap chain and resources. Each method is
  *forward* (append a record), *shadow* (state the app reads back, such
  as GetRenderState, GetTransform and caps, answered from a guest copy)
  or *sync*. Lock returns a guest buffer and Unlock sends the dirty box.
  SM1–3 bytecode passes through untouched. `CreateDevice` sets the x87
  control word to PC=24 unless `D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE`, like native
  (doc 13's PC=24 path exists for this). Code may come from current Wine
  (LGPL, ADR-006).
- **Guest `d3d8.dll`:** D3D8 over our d3d9 in the d3d8to9 shape (BSD-2),
  in C: `d3d8.c` includes `d3d9.c` and wraps its objects. `gen_vtbl8.py`
  generates the vtables from mingw's `d3d8.h`, since the two headers
  cannot coexist, and D3D8-only structs keep the headers' `pack(4)`.
- **Executor** (`d3dpt/exec/`, C++ behind the C API in `d3dpt_exec.h`):
  a mirror of handles → D3D9 objects over whichever `IDirect3D9` was
  loaded (below). The QEMU device `dlopen`s it
  (`d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_exec_load.c`), so the protocol evolves without a QEMU
  rebuild and QEMU stays C.
- **Present.** The device presents once per frame at `Present` into the
  embed presenter (`embed/embedfx.c`), with none of the GL path's
  front-buffer flush heuristics. The frame is read back through
  GetRenderTargetData; zero-copy through DXVK's Vulkan interop is open
  (M4 track).
- **Fallback.** With no executor the device reports
  `D3DPT_STATUS_NO_EXEC`; without our DLLs a game loads Microsoft's d3d9
  and gets its software device.

## The guest DLLs

On XP the display driver's DX8 DDI (doc 15) replaced per-game DLLs; the
DLLs remain the Win98 per-game path and the executor's test harness
(`D3DGAME9`, `D3DGAME8`, `D3DFEAT9`). ADR-021 retires them: once the
driver is a DirectX 9 driver (track M16), those programs run through
Microsoft's runtime on the driver and the DLLs leave the ISO. Fix what a
title needs in the driver, not here.

- **Identity and lifetime (D3D8).** Real D3D8 keeps device- and
  texture-owned objects (surfaces, levels) alive at refcount 0 and hands
  out the same object each time. Each wrapper is created once per
  underlying object (`w8_new`), and owned objects follow their owner
  (`surf_Release` / `res_addref`). Wrappers without that identity died at
  the game's last Release and crashed Vice City.
- **Forwarding.** When the DLL cannot open the device it loads the system
  `d3d9.dll` / `d3d8.dll` from `GetSystemDirectory` and forwards. Vice
  City's process loads both DLLs.
- **Threads.** One encoder and one batch per process. From the first
  `D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED` device on, every method takes `D3DPT_LOCK`, a
  process-wide recursive critical section that `gen_vtbl.py` /
  `gen_vtbl8.py` wrap around every method, and the QEMU log says `calls
  are serialised from now on`. Other devices pay one load and a branch
  per call. The lock is dropped at `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH`, since a thread
  killed at exit may hold it.
- **Buffer locks nest**; the last Unlock sends the union of the ranges.
  `Lock(offset, 0)` means "to the end" and returns `data + offset`.
- **State blocks** are guest-side and never on the wire. While one
  records, setters update only the shadow and the block's marks, and
  EndStateBlock restores the shadow from a snapshot taken at
  BeginStateBlock, as native D3D does.
- **DEFAULT-pool offscreen plain surfaces** keep a guest shadow so a 2D
  game can Lock them. UnlockRect sends the locked rectangle to the host,
  ColorFill (32-bit formats) and UpdateSurface keep the shadow current,
  and nothing the host renders comes back into it.
- **DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP** copies vertices from MinVertexIndex on and
  the executor rebases the indices. DXVK reads MinVertexIndex +
  NumVertices strides from the pointer, so a copy from 0 read past the
  record. **Clear** goes as records of at most 64 rects.
- **`CheckDeviceFormat` answers the usage.** R8G8B8 is not listed: DXVK
  does not map it, and 3DMark2001 SE quit when a render-target texture it
  was told it could have failed to create. A `D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`
  question gets yes only for A8R8G8B8, X8R8G8B8, R5G6B5, X1R5G5B5 and
  A1R5G5B5, which every Vulkan device renders to, since the guest cannot
  ask the host. A depth-stencil question and `CheckDepthStencilMatch` get
  yes only for depth formats.
- **GetRenderTargetData** sizes rows from a format table the guest and
  executor share (`fmt_block` / `rt_bytes_per_pixel`) and refuses a
  format it cannot size.
- **The `D3DPT\DDRAW.DLL` shim** answers Vice City's DirectDraw
  video-memory check, implements `GetRasterStatus` and the gamma ramp,
  and lists all the adapter's modes. Its QueryInterface counts a reference
  on the real `IDirectDraw7` too, since Release drops both.
- **Hand-assembled shaders.** SM1 opcode numbers are the `D3DSIO_*`
  values (`m4x4` is 20; 24 is `m3x2`). A wrong opcode compiles in DXVK
  and draws nothing; dump the SPIR-V with `DXVK_SHADER_DUMP_PATH`.
- **Stubs log once** (`D3DPT_STUB`: `d3dpt: <name> not implemented`):
  - palettized (P8) textures (`SetPaletteEntries` /
    `SetCurrentTexturePalette`), so Vice City's menu background is grey
    noise. DXVK has no P8; the plan is the DDI path's answer, expansion to
    A8R8G8B8 on upload and a re-upload on a palette change;
  - volume textures and swap-chain objects (`GetSwapChain` fails while
    `GetNumberOfSwapChains` says 1);
  - `GetFrontBuffer` (Max Payne calls it) and `ProcessVertices`;
  - `LockRect` on render targets and depth surfaces (refused with
    INVALIDCALL), and D3D8 `CopyRects` into system memory;
  - the lost-device protocol (`TestCooperativeLevel` always succeeds).

  D3D8's `GetVertexShader` / `GetPixelShader` return the handle last set,
  not one an applied state block set.

### A review of the guest DLLs

Most of the behaviour above came from a review of `d3d9.c`, `d3d9_res.h`,
`d3d9_p3.h`, `d3d8.c` and the DDRAW shim against the executor and DXVK.
Its regression cases live in `D3DFEAT9`, compared with the native DXVK
run: row E (one quad each for UpdateTexture into a DEFAULT texture,
MinVertexIndex, `Lock(offset, 0)` and nested locks), an 80-rect Clear, a
state block recorded and never applied, a lock of a DEFAULT offscreen
surface and a readback from an A16B16G16R16F target. Its device is
`D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED`, and a loader thread creates, fills and
releases a texture and a vertex buffer beside the frames, counting failed
calls and failed Presents into a "getters 3" line (native: 0). The loader
is paced to two rounds a frame: DXVK frees a released resource only after
the frames that could use it, and unpaced it reached 17.8 GB on the M1 in
five seconds. `DDVMTEST` uses an object after releasing a
QueryInterface'd reference, and `d3dpt-exec-test` sends a
DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP at MinVertexIndex 0xfff000.

Controls: the pre-review DLLs fail exactly `guest-F9` (CreateVertexBuffer
returns E_FAIL after the first UpdateTexture; `batch error 3`),
and the DLLs with `D3DPT_LOCK` compiled out fail `guest-F9-log=native`
with `3 presents failed`. That check fails when the race is hit, not
whenever the lock is missing, and the DDRAW case is a smoke test, not a
proof. The D3D8 constant fix (`D3DVSD_CONST` of a second block at its own
register) has no case, since D3DGAME8 has no shader. Build a control's
DLLs with the ISO's flags: the default UCRT imports
`api-ms-win-crt-*.dll`, which XP lacks.

## The executor and its Direct3D 9

One decoder serves four D3D9 libraries; only the `IDirect3D9` behind it
changes. Nothing backend-specific goes into the decoder.

| Backend | Where | Picked by |
|---|---|---|
| DXVK (`libdxvk_d3d9`) | in process, Linux, macOS 26+, Windows | default everywhere; the goldens are DXVK's |
| the system `d3d9.dll` | in process, Windows below the Vulkan 1.3 floor | `D3DPT_D3D9=system` (ADR-007's second amendment) |
| Wine's d3d9 | a Wine process on a Linux or macOS host below the floor | `D3DPT_EXEC=wine` (ADR-018, M15) |
| none | a host with neither | `D3DPT_EXEC=none` or no library: `D3DPT_STATUS_NO_EXEC` |

`D3DPT_D3D9=auto|dxvk|system` reaches the adapter as `d3d9=` (the machine
form's Direct3D row), `D3DPT_EXEC=auto|dxvk|wine|none` as `exec=`. The
launcher's Vulkan probe (`launcher-core/src/host_gpu.rs`) resolves `auto`
for `d3d9=`; it is the only part of the system that can tell a software
Vulkan device from a hardware one. `no-exec=on` refuses before any
library is opened, so it never reaches a backend.

**DXVK.** DXVK's d3d9 is a complete D3D9 with a Windows-free build (the
former dxvk-native). We give it a headless WSI (`patches/dxvk/04`, `08`
for Windows; `DXVK_WSI_DRIVER=Headless`) and an off-screen swap chain.
On macOS it runs on KosmicKrisp, which needs macOS 26 (ADR-007, spike C).
DXVK with no Vulkan loader calls through a null pointer in
`Direct3DCreate9`, and unloading a library after a failed probe crashed
too, so the executor looks for `libvulkan` before it tries DXVK and never
closes a probed library.

**Depth formats.** `depth_norm()` maps what 2001 cards offered and DXVK
refuses: D32 → D24X8, D15S1 and D24X4S4 → D24S8. The guest keeps
reporting the format asked for. Without it Max Payne's D32 auto depth
buffer failed and the game said, in 32-bit modes, that it "requires a
DirectX 8 compatible display adapter". `d3dpt-exec-test` asks for D32.

**The system Direct3D 9 (Windows).** On a Windows host DXVK cannot serve
(no Vulkan 1.3, or only a software device), a real card's own D3D9 driver
is faster. Everything it refuses and DXVK accepts sits behind
`Exec::native` (`d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec.cpp`):

- a hidden 1×1 popup is the device window;
- `Exec::scene_begin` opens a scene itself (on both backends, since the
  DX7 DDI's DP2 stream has no BeginScene) and closes it before every
  StretchRect, readback and Present;
- the back buffer is read before Present: `D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD`
  leaves it undefined afterwards on real hardware (the black frames),
  while DXVK keeps it;
- `TestCooperativeLevel` once per batch, `Reset` on loss, and
  `exec_ddi_device_reset` drops the DEFAULT-pool mirror so every surface
  is read from guest VRAM again;
- hardware vertex processing, and a windowed back-buffer format not the
  desktop's, are retried rather than refused;
- NVIDIA's d3d9 lists `D3DFMT_L6V5U5` and draws it with no luminance, so
  this backend uploads it as X8L8V8U8 (`d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_ddi.cpp`).

It is a second rasteriser, so the goldens stay DXVK's and
`d3dpt-dp2-test` / `d3dpt-exec-test` run on both backends whenever either
changes; their frames were byte-identical on the user's PC. The one
measured difference: the X byte of an X8R8G8B8 target reads back `0xff`
from DXVK and `0x00` from NVIDIA's d3d9 (`px0 0xff203040` against
`0x00203040`, D3D7TEST on Win98). The format leaves it undefined and
nothing here reads it; a title that treats X as alpha would differ, so
start there if one does.

### The executor on Wine, in another process

A Linux or macOS host below DXVK's floor runs the same executor on Wine's
own d3d9 (ADR-018; state, measurements and test loop in
`docs/tracks/m15-wine-executor.md`). Wine's d3d9 exists only inside a
Wine process, so the executor runs there: the Windows build of
`d3dpt_exec.dll`, unchanged, loaded by `d3dpt-exec-host.exe`
(`d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_host.c`) under Wine. QEMU talks to it through
`libd3dpt_exec_remote` (`d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_remote.c`), which exports
the entry points of `d3dpt_exec.h` again, so `d3dpt_exec_load.c` opens it
like the in-process library. It does so when that library's
`d3dpt_exec_probe` found no device, or when `exec=wine` asks.

- **The wire** (`d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_remote.h`): 32-byte records over the
  child's stdio, synchronous, one per call.
- **The shared file.** Every region with a size (the command window,
  VRAM, the frame the executor presents) is a region of one file the
  library owns (`d3dpt_exec_shared_alloc`). QEMU maps it as guest RAM
  with `memory_region_init_ram_from_fd` (the adapter's VRAM through patch
  73), the child with `MapViewOfFile`, so a batch runs where the guest
  wrote it and a readback lands in VRAM with no copy. A caller whose
  window is not shared memory (the host tests) is served by copy, said
  once in the log. `memory_region_init_ram_from_fd` is under
  `CONFIG_POSIX`, so both call sites carry the guard; the Windows build
  has no remote executor.
- **The reply** carries the executor's `active` flag, the presented
  frame's geometry (its pixels in the frame slot) and up to 64
  `vram_dirty` ranges, folded into one past that.
- **The child's Wine.** It sets `D3DPT_D3D9=system` for the executor
  (under Wine, Wine's builtin `system32\d3d9.dll`) and writes
  `HKCU\Software\Wine\Direct3D\renderer` = `gl` into its prefix
  (`D3DPT_WINE_RENDERER` overrides; `vulkan` over MoltenVK is a data point
  only). The library starts it with `WINEDEBUG=-all` and
  `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=d3d9=b;mscoree,mshtml=` unless set: Wine's own d3d9,
  never a DXVK dropped into a prefix, and no Mono/Gecko prompt in a new
  prefix. The prefix is `wine/` in the data directory
  (`~/.local/share/2ksbox/wine`; `D3DPT_WINEPREFIX` overrides); creating
  it takes ~20 s. On a Mac the Wine process is x86_64 under Rosetta:
  native arm64 Wine's `winemac.drv` has no OpenGL, and a `MAP_SHARED`
  file is the same pages under Rosetta.
- **The device is made at probe time.** A wined3d device takes seconds
  to create (3.5 s under Rosetta), and the first batch stalls while
  wined3d compiles shaders. Made at the first `create()`, inside the
  guest's MMIO read of the status register, that stall reset a Win98
  guest. The child makes it at `d3dpt_exec_probe`, which the adapter's
  realize runs before the guest boots.

Through the child, `d3dpt-dp2-test` and `d3dpt-exec-test` draw frames
byte-identical to in-process DXVK (the `exec-wine` check), and the XP and
Win98 guests give the in-process verdicts; the numbers are in the M15
track doc.

## Shipping it

QEMU links no executor: it `dlopen`s `libd3dpt_exec` by a search starting
at `build/d3dpt`, and the executor `dlopen`s DXVK's `d3d9` the same way.
A package with the player and not those two has guests with no
Direct3D, so every packager stages both or neither
(`lib/2ksbox/libd3dpt_exec.so` + `libdxvk_d3d9.so.0`, the second under
the soname the executor looks up). The remote library and the PE pair
(`lib/2ksbox/wine/`) likewise go all or none. The Flatpak builds the
libraries in its sandbox against the runtime (hence `third_party/dxvk`
in its source copy: the executor needs its `include/native` headers);
its pair, and the Wine that runs it, are the app's add-on
`com._2ksbox.Launcher.Wine` mounted at that directory (M15 step 7), and
the player names that Wine to QEMU as `D3DPT_WINE`. No Vulkan driver
travels with the Linux packages; the macOS app carries the LunarG loader
and KosmicKrisp. The packaged player names the files to QEMU through
`player/src/companions.rs`, and packagers check `player --companions`,
which prints what that rule resolved. `D3DPT_EXEC_LIB` /
`D3DPT_DXVK_LIB` point `tools/d3dpt-exec-test` at a staged pair, the
cheap proof that the files themselves work.

## Milestones (P = paravirt)

All done in M4. What stayed open is in the stub list above and the M4
track doc.

- **P0a. Reference workload, golden on the rig.** `D3DGAME9.EXE` /
  `D3DGAME8.EXE` (`guest-tools/src/d3dgame9.c`, `d3dgame8.c`, shared
  `d3dgame.h`, on the ISO): a deterministic scene with textured lit
  indexed cubes, a per-frame dynamic vertex buffer, additive particles
  from DrawPrimitiveUP, render-to-texture, DXT1/565/8888 mipmapped
  textures, fixed-function lights, an optional SM1.1/2.0 path with D3DX,
  windowed and fullscreen. `-frames N` runs a fixed-step sequence;
  `-dump N file.bmp` writes frame N. The rig (doc 09) runs both; the
  golden set is `reference/d3d/rig-2026-09-03/` (its README lists the
  caveats: mask the HUD bars, which are wall time; `-shader` is vs_1_1
  with a fixed pixel stage because d3dx9_36 refused ps_1_1). Rendering
  is frozen at that build until a new golden set exists;
  `tools/bmpdiff.py` compares.
- **P0b. The executor spike.** DXVK's d3d9 does not run on MoltenVK
  (five required features missing, two unimplementable on Metal); it
  does on KosmicKrisp with `geometryShader` and `fillModeNonSolid` made
  optional (`patches/dxvk/02`, `05`). ADR-007: DXVK everywhere.
  `tools/dxvk-d3d9-test.cpp` and `tools/d3dgame9-native.cpp` (the
  unmodified scene over `tools/d3dgame-native/win32_headless.h`) match
  the rig golden to 0.35 % of pixels beyond a channel tolerance of 8 on
  RADV (1089 pixels) and KosmicKrisp (1095), HUD masked. ADR-013 kept
  "an executor on something else" as an unbuilt escape hatch; ADR-018
  takes it with Wine on the host.
- **P1. Transport and device.** Patch 40, the encoder, the executor as
  `libd3dpt_exec`, DXVK's headless WSI, the guest `d3d9.dll`. D3D9TEST
  640×480 windowed on XP under TCG (Linux, RADV): 2840 fps on the device,
  1100 on WineD3D-in-guest, 4300 replaying the same batches natively. One
  doorbell per frame.
- **P2. Resources and fixed function** (`d3d9_res.h`): buffers, textures,
  Lock/Unlock, states, transforms, lights, every Draw variant, render
  targets, depth/stencil. D3DGAME9 through the device is byte-identical
  to the native DXVK frame, windowed and fullscreen, 8888 and 565.
- **P3. Shaders and queries** (protocol v3, `d3d9_p3.h`): declarations,
  constants, queries, state blocks, cube textures, DEFAULT offscreen
  surfaces, ColorFill/StretchRect/UpdateSurface/UpdateTexture, clip
  planes. `D3DFEAT9` (hand-assembled SM1.1, no D3DX) is byte-identical
  between guest and native.
- **P4. D3D8** (`d3d8.c`). D3DGAME8 is byte-identical to D3DGAME9.
- **P5. Later.** The "proper driver" became ADR-008 / M7: a real XP
  display driver on the same transport and executor (doc 15), and the
  Win98 driver (doc 19). The DLLs stay the 9x per-game path.

The first commercial titles on the DLL path were Max Payne (to its
tutorial level) and GTA Vice City (to its menu), both headless. Vice City
is Direct3D 8, like every RenderWare GTA through it; San Andreas is the
D3D9 one. A user who deleted `D3D8.DLL` "because VC is D3D9" ran the game
on XP's stock d3d8 over the Cirrus, where it cannot start. A game that
seems frozen on the device has so far always been a message box behind
its full-screen window (`tools/xp-game-test.sh`, M4 track).

## Reference workloads and conformance

- **Ours.** `D3DGAME9` / `D3DGAME8` (P0a) and `D3DFEAT9`, golden or
  native-DXVK frames.
- **Wine's d3d8/d3d9 test suites** (`dlls/d3d9/tests/*.c`, LGPL):
  thousands of API and pixel tests that pass on real Windows; they build
  with mingw and run on XP. The rig gives the pass list, then the device
  runs them. Not wired in yet.
- **Irrlicht** (zlib): D3D8 and D3D9 renderers with engine-shaped sample
  apps; builds with mingw.
- **Commercial titles** (doc 04's matrix) are the acceptance bar.

## Risks

- **Host Vulkan.** MoltenVK lacks DXVK's required features; KosmicKrisp
  needs macOS 26. Below the Vulkan 1.3 floor the executor runs on the
  system d3d9 (Windows) or Wine (Linux, macOS), and with neither the
  guest has no Direct3D pass-through.
- **Doorbell cost under TCG.** Each doorbell is a TCG exit; batching per
  frame keeps it to a few. qemu-3dfx's 500+ fps wglgears on the Air bounds
  the transport.
- **Lock-heavy games** (per-frame dynamic buffers) go through the window
  and DXVK's upload path; the DDI path keeps vertex buffers in VRAM (doc
  15, v9).
