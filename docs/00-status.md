# 0. Status and how to resume (updated 2026-09-23)

The handoff for a new session: the tracks and what each owns, where each
area stands, the everyday commands, open threads, next steps and the
gotchas that cost a day each. Current state only; a fixed thing moves to
its design doc and the commit log. Decisions are in doc 10, the
milestone plan in doc 08, test tools in `docs/testing.md`, build stages,
player options and logs in `docs/development.md`.

## Tracks (pick one per session)

Work runs as parallel tracks, one session each. Each track doc has its
scope, owned files, state, test loop and ordered next steps. This table
is the index.

| Track | Doc | Owns | State · next |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M4** paravirtual Direct3D device | `tracks/m4-d3d-device.md` | `d3dpt/exec/`, `d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_mm.c`, `guest-tools/src/d3dpt/`, `scripts/test.sh`, doc 14 | Done; the Win98 DLL path and the executor's harness · a game by hand, the P8 and other stubs, zero-copy present |

| **M9** TCG on Apple Silicon | `tracks/m9-tcg-aarch64.md` | `tools/tcg-profile.*`, `tools/tcg-hot.py`, the TCG patches from 13 on | Done; optimization closed by user decision (2026-09-12) · patch 21's crash, binary32 at PC=24 slower than PC=53 on aarch64, the game tests uncapped on the Air |
| **M10** Win98 display driver | `tracks/m10-win98-driver.md` | `guest-tools/src/d3dptvid/core/` and `w9x/`, `guest-tools/build-driver*.sh`, `setup.c`'s 9x role, `tools/win98-*.sh`, doc 19, ADR-012 | Active; steps 0–4 done, step 5 (real titles) under way · the ACPI standby resume |

| **M15** Direct3D executor on Wine | `tracks/m15-wine-executor.md` | `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_host.c`, `d3dpt_exec_remote.c`, `d3dpt_remote.h`, the loader's library choice, `build-d3dpt-exec.sh --wine`, `player/src/companions.rs`, `launcher-core/src/host_gpu.rs` | Steps 1–7 done: the community app passed on a real macOS 15, WineD3D-in-guest was removed, and the Flatpak's Wine add-on `com._2ksbox.Launcher.Wine` was built and checked in the sandbox (2026-09-23) · a game through the add-on on a below-floor host; the spike's host tests on the rig's Linux Wine |
| Everything else (Glide on macOS / Windows, M2's leftovers) | "Next steps" below | | as listed |

Rules: work on `main` or on a branch `track/<name>-<topic>` off it,
rebased on `main` before pushing and merged when green. Edit shared files
(`d3dpt/d3dpt_proto.h`, `d3dpt/exec/`, `scripts/test.sh`, `player/`,
`CLAUDE.md`, this doc) minimally and name the track in the commit
message. In this doc a track edits only its own row here, its "Where
things stand" row and its lines under "Next steps"; everything else goes
in its track doc. A merged track's branch and worktree are deleted.
Branches still on the remote: `track/m10-win98-driver` and
`voodoo2-mmio-holes` (merged), `track/m9-hwmmu` (the hardware-MMU gauge,
parked), `m14-glide3` (abandoned, tagged `m14-glide3-abandoned`) and
`track/m14-voodoo2-sli` (an SLI pair and the Voodoo 3's screen filter,
unmerged). The Mac pulls `main`.

## Where things stand

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| QEMU | v9.2.4 + qemu-3dfx (`d00e858`) + our patches 01–73 (`patches/qemu/README.md`). Built without display, host-audio, extra network or network-block backends (the `no-optionals` check). Windows QEMU is built with clang (patch 68); the Mac build needs no XQuartz (patch 70). |
| Emulated CPU (TCG) | x87 shadows at PC=24/53/64 (doc 13), SSE and SIMD inline (doc 16), the M9 queue (REP, same-value SMC, soft immediates, inline TB lookup, TLB work). Default is 2.34x geomean over pristine 9.2.4 on the Air, all switches off 0.97x (doc 22). Every patch has an off switch in the machine form except `pinned-regs` (patch 21, doc 18), not offered: it crashes XP. The hardware-MMU design (1.1–1.2x) is parked (user decision, 2026-09-16). |
| Player | QEMU in-process (`libqemu-embed`, embed API v8), wgpu + librashader CRT chain, mode analysis (doc 03), the embed audiodev (f32, paced to the guest's clock, limiter; doc 11), guest cursor as the window cursor, gamepads, host modifier keys, Alt+F4 asks. Options: `docs/development.md`. |
| OpenGL / Glide pass-through | In the player on Linux (EGL), macOS (CGL) and Windows (WGL, doc 12 "The WGL rule"). Zero-copy: dma-buf ring on Linux (repairs a slot that stops being written through), IOSurface on macOS. Glide 2 through our OpenGLide build (doc 12 §5); game evidence is headless only (Rayman 2, Carmageddon DOS). No Windows Glide wrapper. Glide 3 wrapper abandoned for the Voodoo 2 device. |
| Voodoo 2 (doc 21) | `-device voodoo2`, 86Box's chip. 3dfx's own Win98 driver runs Quake II, UT and NFS Porsche (the user, by hand). FIFA 2000's and Carmageddon's FIFO hangs fixed (doc 21 §11, §13). 8 MB board by default (`texmem=2`), command FIFO in guest RAM (`ramfifo=on`, Quake II 41 → 147.5 fps). Open: a second game after one quits sometimes starts glitched. |
| Direct3D executor (doc 14) | Protocol v13, one decoder, four D3D9s. DXVK (native and on Windows) is the default and the golden reference. Below the Vulkan 1.3 floor: Windows' own `d3d9.dll` (`D3DPT_D3D9`, ADR-007's second amendment) or Wine's on a Linux / macOS host (`exec=wine`, ADR-018, M15). `no-exec=on` models a host with no executor. |
| XP display driver (doc 15) | `d3dpt-vga`, register set v5. DirectDraw and a DirectX 8 DDI with hardware T&L, shaders 1.x, palettes, colour keys, VRAM buffers, 16 streams, cube / volume textures, MSAA, gamma. FIFA 2000, Max Payne, Vice City, Moto Racer and Diablo play. |
| Win98 display driver (doc 19) | The same core under a 9x layer; the default adapter for a new Win98 machine. The DirectX 3–8 checks pass as on XP, and a 2ksbox Win98 runs DirectX 9.0c. Crimson Skies, 3DMark 99 / 2001 SE, Carmageddon (Mode X), Blood in a DOS box. Blue screens and power-down show. |
| CD-ROM (docs 05, 17) | `libdisc` behind the `cdimage` driver: cue/bin, CCD, MDS, ISO and `isodir:` folders, L-EC, subchannel, CD-DA, a DVD profile past 80 minutes, the disc shelf from inside the guest (patch 52, `CDSHELF`; the listing names the disc in the drive from the medium itself, boot disc included). SafeDisc 1.x's band read is the negative control; SafeDisc 2.x and ProtectCD never read theirs. |
| Music (doc 20) | OPL3 and MPU-401 (no IRQ line) on SoundFont GM or the user's MT-32 ROMs. The SB16 applies its mixer (patch 61). Open: Win98's own MIDI through our port loses instruments. |
| Gamepads (M13) | USB HID pad (patch 26), gameport (patch 27), key mapping. Done. |
| Guest machines (doc 06) | Four families: Win98, XP, DOS, Other. Win98 / XP start on `d3dpt-vga`, DOS / Other on `std`. No network card by default. Win98 is TCG with `hpet=off`; the BIOS date stamp makes it install ACPI. DOS paces with `-icount …,align=on`. |
| Guest tools (`guest-tools/README.md`) | One ISO. `SETUP.EXE` installs what this Windows can use; every program logs to `C:\2KSBOX` (`BOXLOG=` overrides). |
| Launcher (doc 07) | `launcher-qt` over `launcher-core` (also `launcherx`, `launcher-capi`). The machine form is a settings window, a page per section, every picker the style's own combo box over the model's rows; the Direct3D picker shows only what this host runs. Extra QEMU arguments, clone, first-run preset download. The snapshot window is a tree (2026-09-23): a qcow2 records no parent, so the launcher writes each take and restore to `snapshots.toml` beside the bundle and reconciles it against the disk on every read; snapshots it has no record of sit at the top level. Window text is short and plain (user rule). |
| Packages | Linux tarball, Flatpak (`org.kde.Platform` 6.10), macOS app in two builds (ADR-019: App Store 26+, community with the Wine pair at Homebrew's floor, 15.0), Windows zip (cross build; native MSYS2 build for debugging) and, from 2026-09-23, the same tree as a Microsoft Store MSIX (`scripts/package-msix.sh`, packed on the PC; not yet uploaded, `build-windows.md` "The Store package"). Every packager opens a real window offscreen. |
| Tests | `scripts/test.sh host` (~30 s) / `all` (+ XP and DOS guests). Integration only, local only; `docs/testing.md`. |
| Guest images | Outside the repo, read-only for a session: `~/vms/win98.qcow2`, `winxp.qcow2`, `winxp-m7*.qcow2`, `scratch.img` (E: in XP), and the launcher library's machines (`~/.local/share/2ksbox/machines/`: `base98-br`, `base98-us`, `claude98`, `win98-2`, …). Boot an overlay or a copy. |

## Build / run cheat sheet

Stages, player options and packagers: `docs/development.md`. Test tools:
`docs/testing.md`.

```sh
scripts/build.sh           # after every pull: everything, only what changed
                           # (-f re-runs every prepare, --test adds test.sh host)
scripts/test.sh            # host stage; `all` adds the guests (before any
                           # commit touching QEMU, embed, the D3D device, guest DLLs)

```

A bare `qemu-system-i386` needs `-L qemu/pc-bios` by hand (its other
traps are under "Driving a guest headless"). The DOS batteries fetch the
FreeDOS floppy themselves; on a Mac they need `brew install nasm
mtools`.

## Open threads

Unfinished or unexplained things across tracks. A track's own open items
live in its track doc; fixed things leave this list.

- **GL and Glide on a Windows host.** The OpenGL pass-through runs there
  (`GLPROBE.EXE` in `base98-br` reads the host's renderer since the WGL
  fix, doc 12 "The WGL rule"), but no game has run on it. GLQuake is the
  user's next try. The Glide wrapper has no Windows build (doc 12
  "Order"; the package lists `glide` as "(not shipped)").

- **Windows' own Direct3D 9 is unproved on the hosts it is for.** Both
  oracles match byte for byte on both backends, but only on an RTX 3090
  (ADR-007's second amendment). Expect gaps in pre-Broadwell Intel,
  Kepler and TeraScale drivers; next is a real title on such a host with
  `D3DPT_D3D9=system`.

- **Win98's ACPI standby does not come back** (doc 19 §41). Standby
  suspends the VM, input piles up in the embed queue (512 events, 151
  dropped, 20 s late on the user's run), and on wake nothing reprograms
  the adapter, so a blank text page idles back into standby.

- **The zero-copy ring's frozen slot has no known cause.** `zc_probe()`
  repairs it; doc 12 §4 has what was ruled out and the suspects left.

- **3DMark 99 on the Windows PC: two threads** (M14/M11, `base98-br`,
  `scripts/win-voodoo-ab.sh`, log `build/win-voodoo-ab.log`; the FIFO
  hangs are fixed, doc 21 §9).
  - *A garbled loading screen*, seen once, usually the Fill Rate one. It
    is the 800x600 desktop on `d3dpt-vga` in stale bands, not a Voodoo
    frame. `vga:full-frames=on` does not change it, and no flips or
    executor batches run meanwhile, so the guest wrote those bytes. Next:
    which blit draws that background and where it reads from.
  - *The whole machine 3x slower after some guest restarts*, with no
    Voodoo (`no-voodoo`): 46.3, 46.7, 62.4, **15.0**, 37.8 fps across
    restarts in one player run, everything slower by the same factor. Not
    a context leak, the ring falling back to MMIO, or audio or input
    stalls. `d3dpt-vga` reports `N batches in 5.0 s, M ms of them in the
    executor`, and the script passes `-msg timestamp=on`. A flat host
    share with the rate halved points at the guest or the vCPU. Also
    check inside Windows (Performance tab: a file system not "32-bit"
    after hard resets) and the host's CPU use.

- **`GetSwapChain` is a stub** in the guest D3D9 DLL (doc 14, "A review of
  the guest DLLs").

- **The NT side of the 3DMark2001 fixes is not re-run** (doc 19 §38):
  `xp-driver-test.sh install` installed no driver on a `winxp-m7`
  overlay (HEAD's and the previous driver alike), so BUMPTEST on XP is
  unmeasured. It matches the DRVINST Logo-dialog watcher bug fixed since;
  re-run with a current DRVINST.

- **A fault inside a DDI callback leaks the command-window lock** and
  freezes the session until the process dies (doc 19 §36). Accepted for
  v1 (user decision, 2026-09-16). The fix is an exception frame that
  releases the lock on unwind.

- **Win98 `SETUP /ALL` over an installed driver: `WININIT.INI [rename]`
  sometimes lacks the `SYSTEM\` entries** (`VOODOO=1
  tools/setup-guest-test.sh` on `~/vms/win98.qcow2`). All seven copies
  are staged and logged, but the INI read right after holds the four
  `INF\` renames and zero or one of the three `SYSTEM\` ones. Unknown
  whether the 9x profile cache had not flushed yet (`REBOOT=1` shows if
  the restart still applies them) or the renames are lost. That image's
  `SYSTEM\GLIDE*.DLL` and `FXMEMMAP.VXD` are read-only leftovers, so its
  three Voodoo marker checks fail regardless.

- **On the Cirrus, a VESA picture comes out in swapped blocks** (the user,
  in Duke Nukem 3D). The colours were the missing 4F09h, now fixed. Ruled
  out:
  - The chain-4 bug: in VBE modes both adapters map 0xA0000 as a RAM
    alias, so writes never reach `vga_mem_writeb`.
  - The window granularity: the Cirrus's 16 KiB is the hardware's, and
    `tools/vga-dirty-guest-test.py vesa cirrus` passes (`GRAN64=1`
    assumes 64 KiB, as the A/B).

  Untested hypothesis: Build's own Cirrus SVGA driver banks through
  GR9/GRB directly and may disagree with `cirrus_update_bank_ptr` about
  GR0B bit 5. Next: a test that drives those registers both ways round,
  or a log of the game's register writes.

- **Protected discs against the EDC-first cooked read: argued, not
  measured.** Re-run `discx scan` on the rig's protected dumps
  (`docs/tracks/m5-cdrom-backend.md` has the checks, doc 17 §2.5;
  `LIBDISC_NO_CORRECT=1` is the A/B).

- **The CD-ROM drive has no speed model.** It advertises 4x, `SET CD
  SPEED` does nothing, and a whole-disc read runs at hundreds of MB/s.
  `throttling.bps-read=` holds back a `.iso` but not a libdisc image.
  `tools/cd-rate-guest-test.py` shows the bytes do not depend on the read
  rate. Untested: whether a title that paces itself on CD reads minds a
  drive 100 times too fast. That needs a `speed=` on `ide-cd` both
  drivers honour (`docs/tracks/m5-cdrom-backend.md`).

- **Below the Vulkan floor: no real-user numbers.** Nobody has measured
  how many users are below DXVK's Vulkan 1.3 bar, or whether on such a
  host software Vulkan (lavapipe, "available, in software (slow)") beats
  the Wine executor (ADR-013/018, `launcherx --host-check`).

- **3D hand-off sync is `glFinish`** on both platforms. A fence would let
  the vCPU go on while the blit drains (doc 12).

## Next steps, in order

Each track's own order is in its track doc. This is the order across
tracks, plus the items no track owns.

1. **M15, the Direct3D fallback on Wine** (ADR-018,
   `tracks/m15-wine-executor.md` "Steps"). Steps 1–7 are done: the
   packaged community app on a real macOS 15 (the floor, `build-macos.md`)
   runs the game through the Wine executor, user-confirmed on 2026-09-23
   ("works wonderfully"; no frame rate was written down), WineD3D-in-guest
   was removed the same day, and the Flatpak's Wine is the add-on
   `com._2ksbox.Launcher.Wine`, built and checked in the sandbox (the
   track doc has the shape). Left: a game through the add-on on a
   below-floor host, and the spike's two host tests on the rig's Linux
   Wine. A Windows host below the floor is not part of this; it already
   runs its own `system32\d3d9.dll`.
2. **The measurements doc 22 still owes** (user decision, 2026-09-15).
   The Ryzen half of §6.2's games, including 3DMark2001 SE's high-detail
   Car Chase and Lobby as the benchmark for patch 47's inexact mode (+47 %
   and +15 % on the Air). Helper reach on x86-64, where it is the
   *always* case (`call [rip+pool]` from a PIE or a Windows EXE): a Linux
   / Win32 variant of patch 63 as the A/B through `tools/specbench`.
   Three QEMU builds from one tree behind a meson option (switches
   removed / hardwired on / switchable) to price the switches; later,
   "all off plus one switch". Not worth chasing: `bl` reach on the Mac
   (2 %).
3. **Patch 21 (`pinned-regs`)** crashes XP under Super PI with seven or
   eight registers pinned (a bugcheck with auto-restart;
   `tools/specbench/run.sh <image> pinned` reproduces it; doc 18 open
   item 1). It is off and not in the machine form (user decision,
   2026-09-16: 1.1–1.2x at best), so fixing it is optional.
4. **Glide pass-through (M3, doc 12 §5).** The user has never had it
   work by hand, so a hand run of a Glide title is owed; no Glide game has
   run on the DOS family. Then a macOS `glide-host` check (the CGL side of
   `tools/glide-host-test.cpp`) and a Glide guest on the Air, a Windows
   Glide wrapper (M11's cross build has no stage), and fence-based sync
   instead of `glFinish`.
5. **Display (M2, doc 03).** An answer for presets with no resolution
   override. XP's mode table fed from the player and a present
   signal in phase with its swapchain (M7). The player's own overlay
   controls (pause, snapshot, disc swap; doc 07).
6. **Windows host (M11's leftovers).** Moto Racer's speed on the PC
   (CPU-bound, not reproduced on Linux; M11 track doc) and the first
   clang-built QEMU there. The native MSYS2 build run (`scripts/win-run.sh
   launcher`, a machine, the Windows-built ISO in a guest). Live control
   over Winsock AF_UNIX on a real PC. The Store upload (a Partner
   Center identity; the packaged library at `%USERPROFILE%\2ksbox`,
   2026-09-23, has been checked with `LAUNCHER_PACKAGED=1` only:
   `scripts/win-sideload.ps1` installs the package and checks it from
   there, one UAC prompt) and an installer for users outside the
   Store. Zero-copy frames through a DXGI shared handle. A Windows check
   that boots a guest.
7. **M14, Voodoo 2** (its track doc, "Open, in order"): the glitched
   second Glide game, a client resuming on a dead ring, DxDiag's
   Direct3D 7 `GetDC` failure, the Air and the Windows build, Diablo II's
   numbers, patches 64 and 71 upstream.
8. **M10, Win98 driver** (its track doc, "Next steps"): the
   command-window lock (§36), the ACPI standby resume (§41).
9. **M12, music.** One dxdiag music run on Win98 with
   `LIBSYNTH_MIDI_LOG` and `LIBSYNTH_OPL_LOG` set (doc 20 §7.2). Then
   "MPU-401 Compatible" from Add New Hardware, the step Win98 needs
   before it plays MIDI to the port, and a host MIDI port (doc 20 §8).
10. **M6, launcher and packages.** An AppImage (6b′), the Windows
    installer (6d; the MSIX covers the Store, above), the shader preview as a `QQuickRhiItem` (doc 07),
    screenshots for a Flathub submission, `CDSHELF.EXE`'s Win98 (ASPI)
    run.
11. **M5, CD-ROM.** Triage FIFA 2002's no-match. Age of Mythology disc 1
    as a second SafeDisc 2 title. SecuROM (needs DPM in `mds.rs`).
    Multisession. CHD. Win98's CD Player by ear. M5g: a guest-side check
    of the stale-file rule.
12. **The finished tracks' leftovers.** M4: a D3D8/9 game by hand on the
    DLL path, its stubs, a decoder thread. M7: a shader title, a
    split-stream title, 3DMark2001's Nature for cubes, StarCraft / Age of
    Empires on 8 bpp, a driver stage in `scripts/test.sh`, something

## Gotchas

Cross-cutting traps, each as symptom → cause → rule. A trap that belongs
to one subsystem lives in its design doc; pointers are at the end.

### Building

- **Two builds must never share the `qemu/` tree at once.**
  `build-windows.sh` re-applies the patch queue while
  `package-flatpak.sh` copies the tree, and the copy fails deep in the
  compile with a header neither build uses. The outputs (`build/qemu`,
  `build/win/qemu`) are separate; the sources are not.
- **A build belongs to one checkout.** Never point `QEMU_BIN` or any
  `*_BIN` at another checkout's artefacts, configure into its `build/`,
  or run its scripts. That tests someone else's patch queue, and meson's
  recorded source path makes the other build compile *your* sources from
  then on (check `build/qemu/meson-logs/`' "Source dir"). Moving a
  checkout invalidates `build/` too: `scripts/build.sh -f`.
- **A source edit with no effect: is its directory in the stamp?**
  `scripts/build.sh` skips `prepare-qemu.sh` when the hashed inputs of
  `stamp_stale qemu-prepare …` are unchanged, so an overlay missing from
  that list rebuilds the *old* file silently (`libsynth/qemu` was). `-f`
  bypasses every stamp.
- **Removing a patch to A/B it leaves its edits behind.**
  `prepare-qemu.sh` restores only files a *current* patch touches, so a
  dropped patch's changes to other files, and its new files, survive.
  Use the patch's off switch if it has one; otherwise `git checkout`
  those files in `qemu/` and re-prepare.
- **`configure`: "found no usable distlib".** pip 26 vendors
  `distlib.scripts` but not `distlib.version`, which QEMU 9.2's `mkvenv`
  imports. Install the real `distlib` for that interpreter. Python is
  uv's 3.12; 3.14 works only with the real `distlib` (MSYS2).
- **An ISO older than its sources means a stage died.**
  `build-wrappers.sh` is `set -e` and writes the ISO last. On a Mac,
  Homebrew's mingw is a symlink, so `build-driver.sh` finds the DDK
  headers through `-print-sysroot`.
- **Guest binaries are msvcrt and `-march=pentium3`.** Modern mingw links
  the UCRT, which 9x lacks and XP never loads, and qemu-3dfx compiles for
  `x86-64-v2`; the scripts force and check both. Define `PSAPI_VERSION
  1`, or `psapi.h` binds Windows 7's `K32*` exports and XP's loader stops
  the process in a hard-error box before `DllMain`.
- **Host toolchain.** QEMU 9.2 needs `--disable-werror`, `-fPIC` and
  `b_staticpic` for the shared library. On macOS every stage targets
  Homebrew's floor (`scripts/macos-floor.sh`, 15.0 today); a hand-run
  cargo needs `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` exported, and a `cargo clean`
  after the floor rises (`build.sh` does both). The macOS link needs
  `qemu_default_main` (defined in `embed/libqemu_embed.c`) and our ld64
  export list.
- **Windows: `Unable to create index.lock: File exists`, the lock gone
  when you look.** A scanner holds the lock of the git that just exited.
  `prepare-qemu.sh` runs every git through `qgit`, which retries on that
  and nothing else. A retrying wrapper must pass git's stdout through
  (`2>&1 >&3` inside `{ } 3>&1`) or `ls-files` returns nothing.

### Running on a Mac

- **`/opt/homebrew/lib` on `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` kills every image
  decode** (`SIGBUS` at `0xbad4007` in `IIO_Reader_GIF`). dyld searches
  it by leaf name first, and on a case-insensitive disk it answers
  ImageIO's `libGIF` / `libPng` / `libTIFF` / `libJPEG` with Homebrew's.
  Put only `/opt/homebrew/opt/vulkan-loader/lib` there; unsetting it at
  run time is too late. `DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1` shows it.
- **A benchmark a third slower than the last is a far launch.** TCG's
  code buffer 8 GiB from the helpers turns every helper call into
  `movz/movk ×4 + blr` (x87 / SSE helpers at 0.55–0.65x). Patch 63
  reserves it near the image at load time. Check the JIT addresses in a
  `sample` before believing a difference, and use
  `build/specbench/noaslr` for runs that must repeat (doc 22 §5.0).
- **A DXVK program's memory is its peak footprint** (`/usr/bin/time
  -l`), not RSS, because GPU memory is the same RAM. SIP strips `DYLD_*`
  at every system binary, so put `env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=…` last in a
  wrapper chain. A producer that never waits outruns DXVK's deferred
  frees (a 16 GB Mac swapped for minutes; doc 14).
- **Never call `gl*` / `CGL*` / `IOSurface*` by link in the embed
  backend.** The symbol can bind to a GLX library that silently no-ops;
  `dlsym` from the OpenGL.framework handle.

### The player and the QEMU thread

- **Never `exit()` while the QEMU thread is alive.** QEMU's atexit
  handlers race `qemu_cleanup` (`mutex->initialized` on macOS). The
  player joins the thread; headless paths use `_exit`. A guest power-off
  ends the loop while the UI still holds the handle, hence the stop /
  release handshake before `qemu_embed_destroy`.
- **An occluded window gets no swapchain image.** Per-frame work that
  must not stall (importing zero-copy slots) runs on the wake event.
- **A crackle report: ask for the lines first.** `[audio] device asks for
  N frames`, `qemu-embed: audio:` and `[audio] the guest's mix went past
  full scale`. A timing fault and a clipping fault sound alike and read
  differently. Pacing design: doc 11; `tools/audio-glitch-test.py`
  (`STALL=`, `CDAMP=`) reproduces both.

### Driving a guest headless

- **Wait for the guest, never a clock.** `tools/guestwait.sh` waits for a
  line our device wrote, QMP block stats going quiet, or a knock on the
  Run dialog answered on COM1 (`docs/testing.md`, "Driving a guest").
  `BOOT_WAIT` and friends are caps on giving up. A screendump is never
  evidence of life: `vga_draw_text` draws over a dead machine.
- **A frozen first frame with a blinking caret is a guest with no timer
  interrupt**, not a hung emulator. `info registers` twice (EIP
  unchanged), `info pic` (an unmasked `irr` bit with `isr=00`), `info
  lapic` (`LVT0 masked`). Win98's restart was this (patch 22).
- **A "hung" Win98 desktop may be idle and unrepainted**: EIP moving with
  `HLT=1` across two `info registers`. `hang.txt` from
  `win98-game-test.sh` has it.
- **XP's lazy writer holds small FAT writes for minutes.** A harness asks
  COM1, not the scratch disk, whether a command finished.
- **Four shell traps that read as the test failing.** A `pgrep -f` /
  `pkill -f` pattern that appears in the calling command matches the
  wrapper (and `pkill` kills the session's shell); use `patter[n]`. Find
  QEMU with `ps -C qemu-system-i386 -o pid=`, never `pgrep -x` (`comm` is
  truncated at 15 characters). A deep `OUT=` makes the QMP socket fail
  with `AF_UNIX path too long` and the run does nothing. Editing a bash
  script under a running instance breaks that instance.
- **`grep -c` prints `0` and exits 1**, so `$(grep -c x f || echo 0)` is
  `0\n0`.
- **The user's images are read-only.** Boot a qcow2 overlay or a copy;
  while an overlay runs, the backing file is write-locked. Never run two
  TCG guests at once on one box: they starve each other and a slow run
  reads as a failure.
- **End a Win98 run with the ACPI power button** (`system_powerdown`).
  Keystrokes die in a modal dialog, and a machine that does not power off
  leaves the FAT dirty, so the next boot is safe mode: no driver, empty
  logs, exactly like the thing under test failing. A failed boot does the
  same; let the safe-mode boot finish before trusting the next run.
- **Win98 runs under TCG, not KVM** (the family's default). Under `-accel
  kvm` Explorer dies at start ("illegal operation", then *SHELL32.DLL is
  linked to missing export SHLWAPI.DLL:GetFileAttributesA*), so there is
  no Start menu to drive.
- **A bare `qemu-system-i386` has no 3D and opens no window.** QEMU is
  built with no display, host-audio or extra backends (`configure-qemu.sh`,
  the `no-optionals` check; `--disable-dsound` needed patch 23), so
  pass-through is refused for want of a context provider. With no
  `-display`, QEMU starts a VNC server on `localhost:5900`. Look with
  `-display vnc=:0`, and play into `-audiodev none`.
- **A game that "freezes" is often showing a message box you cannot
  see.** The player falls back to the VGA surface after 1 s without a
  presented 3D frame. Headless, `SHOTS=` in the game harnesses shows the
  box and `DRW_AFTER=` the stacks (XP).
- **A glitch shorter than a second shows only in the player's own
  frames** (`PLAYER=1 PLAYER_SHOT_EVERY=6`). QMP screendumps come once a
  second, a headless console refreshes only when asked, and a screendump
  shows the VGA surface, frozen while 3D presents.
- **An API's own answer is not evidence; the device's is.** `mcicda`
  answers `status mode` from the state it commanded (Win98 said
  "stopped" while the drive played on), and a check that greps for a
  *line* proves nothing about the value in it. Ask the device (a trace)
  and the output (the wav, the pixels), and assert the value.
- **Headless changes timing, not just output.** With no device window
  DXVK's `Present` returns at once, so a busy-poll of a query starved the
  thread that had to answer it. Put `Sleep(1)` between polls. A cold
  pipeline cache is the load that makes such a race show.
- **A game that runs far too fast is presenting, not timing.** Era titles
  pace by `Flip`, so a flip that never blocks is a missing frame limiter.
  `d3dpt-vga: N page flips in 5.0 s` is the guest's real frame rate; no
  line means it blits to the primary. `DDFLAGS=32768` turns the vertical
  blank off for the A/B.
- **KVM `-cpu host` breaks Max Payne's level loading** ("Corrupt JPEG
  data": a CPUID-dispatched decoder). `-cpu pentium3` under KVM works.
  Prefer an era CPU model for games.
- **An XP game "crashes at startup" with `0xc0000142`**: a DLL of ours
  returned FALSE from `DllMain`. Either qemu-3dfx's `OPENGL32.DLL` could
  not open `\\.\MAPMEM` (FXPTL.SYS and the MAPMEM service missing:
  install SETUP's Glide component as Administrator; OpenGL needs it
  too), a `D3DPT\` DLL found no executor
  (`D3DPT_STATUS_NO_EXEC`), or the protocol version differs (`d3dpt.log`
  names both).
- **A benchmark inside a DOS `.COM` keeps its data off the code page**,
  or self-modifying-code invalidation dominates the number.

### Windows guests

- **Win98 must be an ACPI install**, or PCI hot-adds (USB tablet, AC'97,
  NIC) are never seen and Device Manager shows "Plug and Play BIOS".
  Setup compares F000:FFF5 with 12/01/99; `prepare-qemu.sh` stamps the
  firmware 12/31/99 (the `bios-date` check), so a plain `SETUP` installs
  ACPI. Repair an older image in Device Manager (`build-macos.md`), don't
  reinstall.
- **"Windows protection error" on `d3dpt-vga`, fine on the Cirrus.** A
  display driver built before 2026-09-12 wants the register set exactly
  and refuses a newer adapter, and `*DisplayFallback=0` leaves no VGA.
  Boot on the Cirrus, run the ISO's `SETUP /ALL`, switch back. Newer
  drivers accept any later register set (doc 15).
- **`ExitWindowsEx` from a console program never returns on 9x** and
  holds the Win16Mutex; a worker thread makes it worse. Call it from a
  process with no console: `SETUP` re-execs itself detached as `SETUP
  /REBOOTNOW`. `rundll32 krnl386.exe,exitkernel` restarts with a dirty
  FAT. The proof of a restart is a second SeaBIOS banner.
- **Never overwrite a loaded 9x driver file in place.** KERNEL reloads
  discarded segments from the new file at the old addresses. Stage it as
  `NAME.EX_` and rename it through `WININIT.INI` on the restart
  (`guest-tools/README.md`).
- **An ISA device of ours must not sit on IRQ 9.** PIIX4 puts the ACPI
  SCI there, so a line only the guest can lower is re-entered on every
  `IRET` until #DF and a triple fault, which looks like a spontaneous
  reboot. DOS masks IRQ 9 and never shows it. Prefer no interrupt line
  where none is needed (doc 20 §5.1).

### Devices and corruption

- **An interrupt a guest cannot acknowledge costs the line, not one
  interrupt.** On the edge-triggered i8259 every later assertion into the
  held line is lost silently (doc 20 §5.2). `info irq` counts rising
  edges, so a count that stops while the device still raises is this.
  Diagnose with `-d trace:pic_set_irq`, `trace-event-set-state
  memory_region_ops_write` over QMP for the ten seconds that matter, and
  the device's own status read from the monitor (`o` / `i`).
- **A crash that moves from victim to victim is memory corruption: A/B
  the TCG switches before the driver.** Win98 dying in `SETUP` was patch
  44's `uint16_t` TLB list wrapping, and one lucky control cost an
  evening. Use `-accel tcg,<switch>=off` per patch, repeat every control,
  and catch the reset with `-action reboot=shutdown,shutdown=pause -d
  cpu_reset`, reading the blue screen out of VRAM.
- **A QMP medium change must pass `force`.** Without it a guest that
  locked the tray (XP, for any open handle) gets an eject *request*, the
  command is refused, and the swap lands whenever the guest lets go.
