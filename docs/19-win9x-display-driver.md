# 19. A native Win98 display driver (ADR-012, M10)

XP has a real display driver for our `d3dpt-vga` adapter (doc 15): a
video miniport, a display driver, and DirectDraw and Direct3D DDIs that
turn the runtime's DP2 token stream into `d3dpt` protocol records for the
host executor. This doc is the Win98/Me driver for the same adapter and
protocol: why it exists, how the XP driver was split into an
OS-independent core and a per-OS layer, and what Windows 9x does
differently. The numbered sections record each fact and trap the
bring-up and real titles taught, with its reason. A launcher Win98
machine runs this driver by default (`bundle::video_choices`); `-vga
cirrus` is one pick away (doc 06).

Read doc 15 first: the adapter, register set, flip chain, DP2 stream,
palettized textures, colour keys, execute buffers and DX8 DDI it
describes are what the core *is*. The track's state, files and test loop
are in `docs/tracks/m10-win98-driver.md`; every test tool named here is
in `docs/testing.md`.

## Why a native driver instead of the wrapper stack

- The Glide and OpenGL wrappers need files in each game's folder; the
  driver needs nothing there. Windows' own `ddraw.dll`, `d3dim.dll` and
  `d3d8.dll` drive it, on 98 as on XP.
- It is the only way a 9x title also gets an accelerated *desktop*:
  modes from our table, page flips that are register writes, no copy
  inside QEMU (doc 15, "Shape").
- The DirectX 3–7 titles that matter on 98 are the ones M7 made work on
  XP through the HAL (execute buffers, colour keys, palettized textures,
  8 bpp modes). On 9x they cost only the per-OS layer.
- The M4 paravirtual device and its guest DLLs are untouched and stay
  the fallback wherever the driver is not installed.

## The split

**The core** is everything about *our* adapter and *our* protocol:

- the DP2 walker (tokens to `D3DPT_DP2_*` records, stream bindings, the
  DX8 rewrite, `TEXBLT`, `BUFFERBLT`, vs/ps 1.x validation);
- the surface table (handles, mip levels, formats and their pitch
  arithmetic including DXT, VRAM offsets, registration, dirty ranges,
  colour-key and palette bookkeeping);
- the caps (`DDCAPS`, pixel-format lists, `D3DCAPS7`, `D3DCAPS8`, the
  `ddflags` knobs);
- contexts, render targets, `Clear2`, readback;
- the flip chain (offset register, frame counter, wait, timeout);
- the heap layout, the encoder, the doorbell and the debug log.

**The per-OS layer** is everything about the operating system: entry
points and packaging, kernel services (memory, mapping, a tick), the
DirectDraw/Direct3D objects the OS hands over (NT's `DD_SURFACE_LOCAL`
against 9x's `DDRAWI_DDRAWSURFACE_LCL`), and GDI (NT's `Drv*` DDI against
9x's `.drv` DDI over the DIB Engine).

```
guest-tools/src/d3dptvid/
  core/  d3dpt_ddi.h   DDI structures identical on every Windows: caps
                       shapes, the DP2 command header and tokens, D3DCAPS8
         d3dpt_core.h  the core's types and the hooks it calls
         core_dp2.c    the DP2 walker
         core_surf.c   surfaces, formats, registration, keys
         core_caps.c   caps and format tables
         core_flip.c   heap layout, vertical blank, debug log, command window
         core_ctx.c    contexts, targets, clear, readback, Z-by-Lock
  nt/    d3dptdisp.c   Drv* + the dxg callbacks + the OS hooks; d3dptvid.c
                       the miniport; .def, .inf
  w9x/   d3dpt9x.c + dibthunk.asm   the 16-bit .drv (Watcom)
         d3dpt9dd.c                 its DirectDraw escapes
         d3dptvxd.c                 the mini-VDD (Watcom)
         d3dpthal.c + .def          the ring-3 HAL DLL, links the core (mingw)
         d3dpt9x.inf, res/, the probes (ddprobe, gdiprobe, pwrprobe,
         devcaps, setbpp, bsod + bsodvxd)
  ddk/   NT DDI headers;  ddk9x/ the 9x ones (MIT, from vmdisp9x)
```

The core is linked into a **kernel-mode** DLL on NT and a **user-mode**
one on 9x, so it may call no operating-system service. Six `d3dpt_os_*`
hooks bring in what it needs, and `build-driver.sh` enforces this with
`nm` (§19). On 9x only `w9x/d3dpthal.c` links the core.

The refactor landed green before any 9x code, so a 9x bug could not
pass for a refactor bug: `d3dpt-dp2-test` and `D3D7TEST` byte-identical
against the same golden, the probes with the same case counts,
`D3DGAME8` still matching the native oracle.

## What 9x does differently

Step 0 answered this by reading JHRobotics' **`vmdisp9x`** (the Win9x
display minidriver behind SoftGPU, derived from Michal Necasek's
VirtualBox minidriver) and its companion HAL **`vmhal9x`**. Both are
cloned to `build/ref/` and read, not vendored; the track doc has the
clone commands.

### 1. A 9x display driver is three binaries, not two

| | XP | Win98/Me |
|---|---|---|
| GDI | `d3dptdisp.dll`, kernel, `Drv*` DDI | a **16-bit NE `.drv`** exporting the Win3.x DDI by ordinal (`BitBlt.1 … ValidateMode.700`), ring 3 |
| drawing | GDI draws into the engine bitmap = VRAM | every drawing export **jumps to the DIB Engine** (`DIBENG.DLL`); the driver keeps `Enable`/`ReEnable`/`Disable`, `Control`, palette, cursor, `ValidateMode` |
| hardware | the miniport `d3dptvid.sys` | a ring-0 **mini-VDD** (`system win_vxd dynamic`) that owns the adapter, maps VRAM and arbitrates the DOS boxes |
| DirectDraw / D3D HAL | in the kernel display driver, called by `dxg.sys` | a **ring-3 32-bit DLL** loaded into the *game's* process by `ddraw.dll` |

Ours are `d3dpt9x.drv`, `d3dpt9v.vxd` and `d3dpt9hl.dll`. The last row
is the good news: the part carrying the DP2 walker and surface table is
an ordinary user-mode Win32 DLL.

### 2. How the 32-bit HAL is published from a 16-bit driver

The `.drv` answers GDI's `Control` escape `DCICOMMAND` (0x0C03) with four
sub-commands:

- `DDNEWCALLBACKFNS` hands it DirectDraw's `lpSetInfo`.
- `DDGET32BITDRIVERNAME` returns a DLL name, an entry point
  (`DriverInit`) and a 32-bit context value. DirectDraw loads that DLL
  and calls the entry.
- `DDCREATEDRIVEROBJECT` builds `DDHALINFO` and calls `lpSetInfo`.
- `DDVERSIONINFO` reports the runtime version.

The context value is the linear address of a block both halves share
(9x maps everything above 2 GiB into every process). `DriverInit` writes
its 32-bit callbacks into that block for the `.drv` to publish. No
registry entry, no signing: DirectDraw loads whatever DLL the `.drv`
names. §20–§23 are how that came to work.

### 3. The DDI structures: identical calls, rearranged objects

- **Per-call structures are field-for-field identical**:
  `DD_CREATESURFACEDATA` / `DDHAL_CREATESURFACEDATA`, and
  `D3DNTHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA` / `D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA` (fourteen
  fields in the same order). Only pointer type names differ; both are
  `__stdcall`.
- **The DirectDraw object structures are not.** NT's `DD_SURFACE_LOCAL`
  has ten members, 9x's `DDRAWI_DDRAWSURFACE_LCL` twenty-six, in another
  order. Every field we read exists on both under the same name at
  different offsets, and `lpGbl->wWidth`/`wHeight` are `WORD` on 9x. So
  the core reads a neutral surface descriptor (§19).
- **The DP2 token stream is the same stream.** Every opcode value agrees,
  and `vmhal9x` sees the full DX8 set in a real 98 guest.

### 4. The DDI does reach DirectX 8 on 9x

`GetDriverInfo2` works as on NT (same GUID, `D3DGDI2_MAGIC`, sub-types,
`D3DCAPS8`), so all of M7c is in scope. 9x's runtime also offers the
pre-DP2 entries (`RenderState`, `RenderPrimitive`, `DrawOnePrimitive`,
`TextureCreate`); a DDI 8 driver may leave them out (§25).

### 5. Caps rules are *not* the same as NT's

- `DDCAPS_GDI` is normal on 9x; on NT it makes dxg drop the whole HAL
  (doc 15). The caps table is per OS.
- On 9x a HAL callback may return `DDHAL_DRIVER_NOTHANDLED` and the HEL
  takes over. On NT a declined `DdBlt` reaches the application as
  `E_NOTIMPL` (doc 15, "Blit caps and the HEL"). 9x's own validator rules
  are in §21.

### 6. Modes come from the registry, not from the adapter

On NT the miniport enumerates the host's mode table. On 9x the **INF
writes the mode list into the registry** (`HKR,"MODES\<bpp>\<w>,<h>"`)
and the driver only validates and sets modes. `d3dpt9x.inf` lists
640×480, 800×600, 1024×768 and 1280×1024 at 8, 16 and 32 bpp, plus two
4 bpp rows that belong to other drivers (§16). `vmdisp9x` ships a tool
to rewrite the list from the adapter; we have none, so on 98 the
player's mode table (M2) applies only up to the INF's list.

### 7. Installation

A plain `Class=DISPLAY`, `signature="$CHICAGO$"` INF matched on
`PCI\VEN_1234&DEV_3D00`, with `HKR,DEFAULT,drv`, `HKR,DEFAULT,minivdd`,
`HKR,,DevLoader,,*vdd` and the mode list. PnP installs it with no
clicks and no `DRVINST.EXE` equivalent (§16).

### 8. Ring 3 reaches the hardware through the VxD

The mini-VDD maps the adapter into the shared arena and publishes the
linear addresses in the shared block. The HAL reads the adapter through
them, registers included, so **the doorbell is a direct register write
from ring 3**, as cheap as on XP, and the VxD needs no `DeviceIoControl`
handler (§20). New against NT: every process with a Direct3D device runs
its own copy of the HAL against one command window, so a lock word in
the shared block serialises the window (§32, §36).

### 9. Toolchain: two compilers

- The `.drv` and the `.vxd` need **Open Watcom v2** (`wcc`, `wcc386`,
  `wasm`, `wlink`); mingw-w64 makes neither format. `build-driver9x.sh`
  picks the host directory from `uname`, so Linux, macOS arm64 and
  Windows all build both. A host without Watcom builds the ISO without
  `DRIVER9X\` and says so. The script applies the post-link fixes wlink
  gets wrong and fails on the silent refusals of §12, §13, §18 and §20.
- The ring-3 HAL builds with `i686-w64-mingw32`, freestanding like the
  NT driver; mingw-w64 already ships `ddrawi.h`, `d3dhal.h` and
  `dmemmgr.h`.
- The 16-bit headers (`gdidefs.h`, `dibeng.h`, `minivdd.h`, `valmode.h`)
  are vendored from `vmdisp9x` under MIT in `ddk9x/` (its README has the
  provenance). No Microsoft DDK is used. The `.drv` links no Watcom C
  runtime, and `wlib` generates `dibeng.lib` from a text import list.

### 10. What this means for the split

The core stays freestanding C with no OS calls, every DirectDraw object
arrives as the neutral descriptor, and of the three 9x binaries only the
ring-3 HAL links the core.

## The driver in the product

- Every Win98 machine the launcher writes defaults to `-vga none -device
  d3dpt-vga,addr=0x02` (NIC pinned at `0x03`), with the Cirrus as the
  other pick. Changing it under an installed guest is a hardware change
  (doc 06).
- The driver ships on the guest-tools ISO as `DRIVER9X\`, installed on
  98/Me by `SETUP.EXE`'s display-driver component
  (`guest-tools/README.md`; §16, §28).
- The test tools keep their own `-vga cirrus` machines, so the in-box
  driver stays exercised. `VGA=cirrus` on `tools/win98-game-test.sh` is
  the standard control.
- The doc 04 Win98 title matrix (this driver against the Glide and
  Cirrus controls, same image, same host) is done (user, 2026-09-23).

## Bringing up the three binaries

### 11. The mini-VDD is not optional

**Windows 98 unmaps the adapter's BARs within the first half-minute of
boot** when nothing claims the device's resources; a `.drv` alone then
reads zeros from PCI config space and GDI falls back to VGA (a
16-colour desktop). The mini-VDD registers with the main VDD
(`VDD_REGISTER_DISPLAY_DRIVER_INFO`) and hands the `.drv` mapped
selectors. The Configuration Manager leaves the resources alone only for
a complete driver set on the devnode, meaning `minivdd=<file>` in its key
(§12). The VxD has to work before the display driver can do anything.

Also learned here:

- **A display driver must carry `oembin` resources** (`config.bin`,
  `colortab.bin`, `fonts.bin`, `fonts120.bin`: machine metrics, the
  Control Panel colour table, the system LOGFONTs), small fixed Windows
  3.1 DDK structures written as C in `res/` and linked to raw binaries.
- **Two debug channels.** The DEBUG register cannot speak before the
  register page is mapped, which is where the interesting failures are,
  so every line also goes to port 0xE9 (`-debugcon file:…`), the
  reliable channel in ring 0.
- **`SYSTEM.INI` is not a shortcut.** Windows rewrites a hand-set
  `[boot] display.drv=` when it re-detects the adapter.

### 12. Linking a VxD that the VMM will actually load

The VMM **never loads a VxD it dislikes, and says nothing**: no
`BOOTLOG.TXT` line, nothing on any channel. Three wlink facts, all fixed
by `build-driver9x.sh`:

- **Every LE object must have base address 0 and the executable flag.**
  wlink leaves 0x10000/0x11000 and marks only the first executable. This
  is all `vmdisp9x`'s `fixlink -vxd32` does.
- **The DDB must be at offset 0 of the code object.** Code, data and
  constants go into one segment of class CODE (`#pragma
  data_seg("_LTEXT", "CODE")` and siblings), giving one object with the
  DDB first; one added `static const` array once moved it and the VMM
  silently stopped loading the VxD. The build checks the map for
  `VXD_DDB` at `0001:00000000`.
- **The entry-table bundle must be type 3 (32-bit).** wlink writes type 2
  because the symbol is data. The fix is one byte.

`BootLog=1` in `MSDOS.SYS` did not refresh `BOOTLOG.TXT` on the test
image, so check the file's date before believing it.

### 13. Why GDI would not load the driver

**One dangling relocation.** Every 9x display driver locks its code
segment with this idiom:

```c
extern char __based(__segname("_TEXT")) *pText;
GlobalSmartPageLock((__segment)pText);
```

It references a *second* segment called `_TEXT`, class `FAR_DATA`. In a
small driver that segment stays empty, and wlink drops it from the NE
segment table but leaves the relocation naming it. KERNEL's loader
refuses the module and logs nothing, which looks exactly like GDI
choosing another driver. Ours takes `CS` instead (same selector, no
relocation), and the build rejects any NE relocation naming a segment
the table does not have.

### 14. Getting the adapter into ring 3

- **The mapping must be one ring 3 can reach.** `_MapPhysToLinear` maps
  into the system arena. The mini-VDD uses `_PageReserve(PR_SHARED, …)`
  and `_PageCommitPhys(…, PC_USER | PC_WRITEABLE | PC_INCR)`, one
  mapping for the VxD and the driver. **This VMM refuses `PC_PRESENT`**
  silently (`_PageCommitPhys` returns 0). It accepts `PC_INCR` only once
  `PC_PRESENT` is gone, and without `PC_INCR` all 128 MB alias onto one
  page. `_CopyPageTable` on the first and last page settles it in one
  boot (`f0000a07` … `f7fffa07` is right; the same value twice is not).
- **The registers are 32 bits wide and the device accepts nothing else**
  (`valid.min_access_size = 4` on the register BAR). A 16-bit compiler
  turns `*(DWORD __far *)p` into two word accesses, which QEMU answers
  with zero and drops, with no log on either side. `RegGet` and `RegPut`
  are hand-written 32-bit accesses (the module is `.386`). Any 16-bit
  code that touches the adapter must do the same.

### 15. The strip of garbage was the message

A 9x fatal exception is a VGA **text** screen, and on this adapter the
linear frame buffer can hide it:

- **QEMU's VGA core keeps its planes interleaved, four bytes to a
  character cell, from VRAM offset 0.** The text page at 0xB8000 lands
  in the first 32 KB of the linear frame, a band of coloured noise across
  the top. It survives the driver's own clear because the VMM writes it
  afterwards.
- If nothing turns the linear mode off, the message sits there unread.
  Before the mini-VDD's screen-switch hooks (§26, §29), every run that
  "stopped at a black desktop" was a machine holding up a message.

`tools/win98-driver-test.sh` (and `win98-game-test.sh`, with `TEXT_AT=`
mid-run) reads that page out of VRAM and prints it; believe it over the
screendump. It first proves the page *is* text (plane 3 untouched, a
handful of attributes, mostly spaces). All three checks are needed: a
32 bpp desktop passes the first on its unused byte, and without them the
tool invents messages from desktop pixels. The first fault it read was
`DIBENG.DLL` dereferencing the `DIBENGINE` pointer pushed by the
`DIBTHK` thunks in `dibthunk.asm`. Ours now follow the reference
driver's thunk list, which thunks neither `ExtTextOut` nor `SetPalette`
and reaches the cursor entries through C.

### 16. Installing it, the way every other driver installs

PnP installs from `d3dpt9x.inf` with no clicks, writes `drv=d3dpt9x.drv`,
`minivdd=d3dpt9v.vxd`, `DevLoader=*vdd` and the mode list into the
adapter's key, and sets SYSTEM.INI's `[boot] display.drv=pnpdrvr.drv`.

**`pnpdrvr.drv` is correct, not a failure.** Windows writes it for every
PnP display driver; no such file exists, and it resolves through the
adapter's key. What once stopped ours loading was the INF lacking a
**`DelReg`**. An adapter that ran the in-box VGA keeps a `CURRENT` key
and a `MODES` tree naming that driver, an AddReg does not remove what it
does not mention, and GDI resolves through the leftovers. The INF deletes
`Ver`, `DevLoader`, `DEFAULT`, `MODES` and `CURRENT` first, and hands
`MODES\4\640,480` to `vga.drv` and `MODES\4\800,600` to `supervga.drv` by
name (a 16-colour mode must resolve to *something*).

- Windows picks the first mode from the `MODES` list, not `DEFAULT,Mode`
  (`32,640,480`), so a fresh install comes up at 800×600×16.
- `NAME_IN_INI=1` on `tools/win98-driver-test.sh` names both halves in
  `SYSTEM.INI` instead, to test "does this build work" rather than "does
  it install". Edit `SYSTEM.INI` in binary: it has CRLF line endings and
  a text-mode rewrite eats a section header.
- A 9x splash screen frozen after a restart is patch 22's APIC bug
  (`patches/qemu/README.md`, `22-upstream-apic-reset-cpuid`), not the
  driver.
- `SETUP.EXE` copies the INF and the three binaries from `DRIVER9X\`
  into `WINDOWS\INF` (the binaries also into `SYSTEM`) and asks for a
  restart; the boot runs the INF. Over an installed driver every file is
  staged and swapped at the restart (§28).

### 17. Ending a run

**End a run with the ACPI power button** (`system_powerdown`), never
keystrokes. A dirty FAT makes the next boot ScanDisk or **safe mode**:
no driver, no VxD, an empty debug log, which reads exactly like the
driver failing. A modal dialog swallows the button as it swallows keys,
so the harnesses press Escape first, and they answer the `install`
run's restart prompt with `alt+n` (the restart is the next run's job).
A faulted machine cannot be shut down: it waits for a key on §15's text
screen, and the printed text page says so.

### 18. Display Settings showed one resolution

The Display applet calls the driver's `ValidateMode` (ordinal 700) once
per registry row, and ours faulted on the first. **Open Watcom takes a
function's attributes from its first declaration.** `valmode.h`
prototypes `ValidateMode` as plain `WINAPI`, so the compiler dropped the
definition's `__loadds` and the export ran on the caller's DS (a thunk's
alias of the applet's stack). The driver hides the header's prototype
with a `#define` around the include, and `build-driver9x.sh` refuses a
`.drv` with any export that neither jumps straight to the DIB Engine nor
loads DGROUP in its first eight bytes. All eight 16/32 bpp modes now
validate and the applet switches the adapter live.

To drive the applet headless on a Portuguese Windows: Run is "Executar"
(`e`; `d` is "Desligar"), `control desk.cpl,,3` loses its arguments, and
Ctrl+Tab does not switch property-sheet tabs. Right-click the desktop
through the USB tablet, press Up and Enter, and click the tab.

### 19. The split, as it landed

`d3dptdisp.c` went from 3 708 lines to 1 975 of NT plus ~1 940 of core
in five files, and the core includes no DDK header of either family.

**Two boundaries, not one.**

- The **DDI payloads** (`D3DDEVICEDESC_V1`, `D3DPRIMCAPS`, `D3DCAPS8`, the
  `DP2COMMAND` header, the `GetDriverInfo2` shapes) are identical on NT
  and 9x (§3), so they live once in `core/d3dpt_ddi.h`. The NT header
  keeps only the NT callback data and tables.
- The **surface objects** differ, so the core reads a flat
  `d3dpt_surf_desc` (handle, caps, caps2, flags, w, h, pitch, linear
  size, `fpVidMem`, resolved D3DFORMAT, pixel-format flags, source
  colour key) and **never keeps the OS's object past the call**. A key
  set before registration is taken off the record; a later one arrives
  through `SetColorKey`. Keeping the object as a `void *` once outlived
  its surface (§36).

**Six hooks, nothing else**: `d3dpt_os_alloc` / `d3dpt_os_free`,
`d3dpt_os_ticks` (the flip timeout's clock), `d3dpt_os_surf` (fill a
descriptor), `d3dpt_os_attached` (attached surfaces that are not mip
levels) and `d3dpt_os_next_mip`. **`build-driver.sh` compiles the core
alone and asks `nm` what it still wants.** Every undefined symbol must be
the core's own, a hook, or `memcpy` / `memset`, because nothing in the
source stops an `Eng*` call in the core and it would fault on 9x
(`ERROR: the core calls out of itself: _EngDebugPrint`).

The layer fills the callback *tables* (they name its functions);
`core_caps.c` decides what they claim. NT's compressed-surface sizing,
every `Drv*` entry, the mode list, palette, cursor and mapping stayed in
the layer. The public `ddraw.h` structures (`DDPIXELFORMAT`,
`DDSURFACEDESC`, `DDSCAPS`) are identical on both, and the core uses
them directly.

**The constant trap.** mingw's public `ddraw.h` lacks
`DDSCAPS_EXECUTEBUFFER` (0x00800000, the DDKs' `DDSCAPS_RESERVED2`), and
the core once spelled it `0x00000800`, which is `DDRAWISURF_HASCKEYSRCBLT`.
NT's layer was unaffected (its DDK definition won); only the core's
vertex-buffer test was wrong, so protocol v9's video-memory vertex
buffers went unrecognised and one `SHTEST` case in nine drew the
previous case's colour. The core now defines its three
DirectDraw-internal bits under its own names (`DDSCAPS_EXECUTEBUFFER_`,
`DDRAWISURF_HASCKEYSRCBLT_`, `DDRAWISURF_HASPIXELFORMAT_`), and each
layer fails to compile if one disagrees with its DDK. This is why the
whole guest battery runs over any core change.

### 20. Publishing the HAL

The chain of §2 runs end to end:

```
d3dpt9x: QUERYESCSUPPORT(DCICOMMAND) -> 0x00000100
d3dpt9x: DCICOMMAND … command=0000000d   (DDVERSIONINFO)
d3dpt9x: DCICOMMAND … command=0000000b   (DDGET32BITDRIVERNAME)
d3dpthal: DriverInit, block at 0x8a7cf000 regs 0x80018000 vram 0x80019000
d3dpt9x: DCICOMMAND … command=0000000c   (DDNEWCALLBACKFNS)
d3dpt9x: DCICOMMAND … command=0000000a   (DDCREATEDRIVEROBJECT)
d3dpt9dd:   the DLL read magic=42463344 version=…
d3dpt9dd: DirectDraw took the HAL
```

The DLL reads the adapter's `MAGIC` register through the mini-VDD's
linear mapping, from ring 3, with no ioctl. Three facts, each of which
looked like something else:

1. **`QUERYESCSUPPORT(DCICOMMAND)` must answer `DD_HAL_VERSION`, not 1.**
   Answering 1 tells DirectDraw it is a DCI driver: it sends one
   `DCICREATEPRIMARYSURFACE` and never asks a DirectDraw question again,
   with no error anywhere.
2. **DPMI cannot give a GDT selector's base.** The mini-VDD builds its
   selectors in the GDT, and `int 31h AX=0006` answers junk for them
   (ignoring its own carry flag). The VxD returns both linear addresses
   (VRAM in `ESI`, the register page in `EDI`, `d3dpt9v.h`).
3. **The pointers in `DDHALINFO` are 16-bit far pointers** (callback
   tables, `lpModeInfo`, `vmiData.pvmList`). The 16-bit runtime walks
   them, and linear addresses make `DDHAL_SetInfo` refuse the HALINFO.

**The shared block** (`w9x/d3dpt9hal.h`) holds a magic and version, the
adapter's linear addresses and VRAM size, the current mode, the `cb32`
table the DLL fills, the DLL's module handle, the DirectDraw tables and
the command-window lock. The `.drv` allocates it through DPMI, which puts
it above 2 GiB. Both toolchains compile it, so every field is
fixed-width and the 16-bit side asserts each DDI structure fits its slot.

Nothing on a Win98 desktop calls `DirectDrawCreate`, so
`tools/win98-driver-test.sh` takes `PROG=<exe>` and names it in WIN.INI's
`run=`. `ddprobe.exe` is the program: caps, video memory, surfaces,
`WaitForVerticalBlank`, flips and a mode test (§30, §33).

**Build checks.** `ld` only *warns* when it cannot find a freestanding
DLL's hand-named entry point, leaving `AddressOfEntryPoint` zero: on 9x
a silent reboot the moment DirectDraw loads the DLL. The build fails on
a zero entry point, a missing `DriverInit` export, an import from
anything but `kernel32`, and an instruction past the Pentium III floor.

### 21. The runtime read the HALINFO and threw it away

**`DDCAPS2_CERTIFIED` in `ddCaps.dwCaps2` makes DirectDraw refuse the
whole driver.** "Certified" is what the runtime says about a driver,
never what a driver claims.

The refusal is invisible. The 16-bit `DDHAL_SetInfo` only *stores* the
HALINFO and returns TRUE; the 32-bit `ddraw.dll` validates it later while
building the `DDRAWI_DIRECTDRAW_GBL`, and on failure its caller silently
builds an emulation-only object. The driver logs "DirectDraw took the
HAL" and every application gets `DDCAPS_NOHARDWARE`. The validator, read
out of the guest's own `DDRAW.DLL` (DirectX 6.1; the rules still hold on
9.0c):

| rule | what the driver must do |
|---|---|
| `dwSize` is 0x130, 0x1cc or larger | the DX3 or DX5+ `DDHALINFO` (ours 0x1cc) |
| the structure is readable | `IsBadReadPtr` over `dwSize` |
| every heap has a non-zero `fpStart`, none `VIDMEM_ISNONLOCAL` | a `VIDMEM_ISHEAP` heap also needs `DDCAPS2_NONLOCALVIDMEM` |
| `vmiData.ddpfDisplay.dwSize == 32` | 8 bpp palettized needs `dwRGBBitCount == 8` |
| each callback table's `dwSize` a multiple of 4 and ≥ its minimum | 0x28 or ≥0x30 DD, ≥0x40 surface, ≥0x10 palette, ≥0x1c execute buffer |
| every callback a `dwFlags` bit claims passes `IsBadCodePtr` | bit index = entry index |
| no `DDSCAPS_OPTIMIZED` in `ddsCaps` | |
| **no `DDCAPS2_CERTIFIED`** | |
| `dwNumModes > 0` implies `lpModeInfo` | |

The object builder adds two more. **`DDCAPS_BLT` requires a `Blt`
callback and SRCCOPY (ROP 0xCC) in `dwRops`**, and
`DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN`, `_OVERLAY`, `_TEXTURE` and `_ZBUFFER` each
require a non-zero, even `vmiData` alignment. A cap claimed without its
conditions throws the HAL away, as dxg does on NT.

Ruled out, so nobody repeats them: `DDHALINFO_ISPRIMARYDISPLAY` (set
it; it was not the cause), `DDHALINFO_MODEXILLEGAL` (but see §30),
`dwHALVersion` either value, `dwVidMemTotal`/`Free`, `EmulationOnly`.

**The 9x `ddflags` bits live in the high half** of the adapter's DDFLAGS
register (`D9F_*` in `w9x/d3dpt9x.h`), clear of the core's.
`tools/win98-driver-test.sh` takes `DDFLAGS=`. `D9F_CERTIFIED`
(0x01000000) puts the bad bit back as a repro; it is the same bit as the
core's `DDF_NO_VOLUME`, so setting one sets both.

### 22. Where the 32-bit HAL has to live

- **DirectDraw loads the HAL and calls `DriverInit` in `DDHELP.EXE`**,
  once per machine. **Every application then validates the stored
  HALINFO in its own address space** (`IsBadCodePtr` per entry, the
  whole object discarded on one failure).
- A DLL in the private arena has a different address in every process,
  so DDHELP's callback addresses are bad pointers everywhere else. **The
  HAL must live in the shared arena above 2 GiB.** The reference bases
  `vmhal9x.dll` at `0xB00B0000`, and so do we (§23).
- As a safety net the `.drv` withholds any `cb32` entry below
  `0x80000000` (`the 32-bit HAL is at=…, below the shared arena:
  callbacks withheld`), because one unreachable callback costs the whole
  HAL, video memory and mode list included. The build fails a DLL based
  below `0x80000000`.
- A near-pointer trap: the `.drv` is small-model, and `*(DWORD
  *)&tbl.entry` into the far shared block truncated to an offset and
  stored into the driver's own DS. The flags went through the far
  struct, the validator skips zero entries, and the runtime "accepted" a
  HAL with an empty callback table.

`ddprobe` runs the runtime's own test from the application's process:
`GetModuleHandle` / `LoadLibrary` / `IsBadCodePtr` on the HAL.

### 23. The shared arena: `IMAGE_SCN_MEM_SHARED`

**The 9x loader puts a PE DLL based above `0x80000000` into the shared
arena only if every section is marked `IMAGE_SCN_MEM_SHARED`**
(`0x10000000`). Otherwise it relocates the DLL into the private arena,
and a DLL with its relocations stripped fails `LoadLibrary`. GNU `ld` has
no switch for the flag (MSVC's is `/SECTION:…,S`), so a post-link step in
`build-driver9x.sh` ORs it into every section of `d3dpt9hl.dll` and
recomputes the PE checksum. The HAL then loads at `0xB00B0000` in DDHELP
and in every application.

### 24. The DirectDraw DDI

- **The HAL links all five core files** with its own `memcpy`/`memset`
  (`kcrt.c`, `rep movsd`) and imports only kernel32. Its hooks are a
  shared heap (§32), `QueryPerformanceCounter`, and surface descriptors
  from `DDRAWI_DDRAWSURFACE_LCL` (`lpAttachList` for attachments,
  `DDSCAPS_MIPMAP` for mips).
- **VRAM addresses are linear on 9x.** NT's `fpPrimary` is 0 and heap
  offsets are zero-based; 9x's `vmiData.fpPrimary` is the linear VRAM
  address, so `d3dpt_os_surf` subtracts it to give the core a true VRAM
  offset.
- **Surface callbacks** (`d3dpthal.c`, structures in `w9x/ddhal32.h`):
  `Flip32` (waits on the frame counter with `DDFLIP_WAIT`, else
  `DDERR_WASSTILLDRAWING`; reads back live render targets; writes the
  target's VRAM offset to `D3DPT_FB_REG_OFFSET`), `GetFlipStatus32`,
  `GetBltStatus32`, `Lock32` (readback of live targets), `Unlock32`
  (`D3DPT_OP_VRAM_DIRTY`; Z buffers, §34), `DestroySurface32`,
  `SetColorKey32`. `ddprobe`'s five flips pace at ~16 ms, with the
  scanout offset alternating in the QEMU log.
- **8 bpp.** `ModeOk` checks `D3DPT_FB_CAP_BPP8`. `Enable` sets up
  GDIINFO for a palette (`RC_PALETTE`, 20 reserved, 256 registers) and
  the DIB Engine's `PALETTIZED`. The `SetPalette` export (ordinal 22) is
  C and feeds `D3DPT_FB_REG_PALETTE`. The colour table is reserved in the
  PDEVICE at every depth (§30) and initialised at `Enable` (§26).

### 25. The Direct3D DDI on 9x

**Both halves pass XP's bar with no change to `core/`**:

- `EBTEST` 5 of 5 (the DirectX 3 face);
- `D3D7TEST`'s frame through `d3dim700.dll` byte-identical to
  `d3dpt-dp2-test`'s golden, at 59 fps with the flip pacing holding
  under load;
- `SHTEST` 9 of 9 with hardware vertex processing (`vs 1.1, ps 1.4`);
- `CKTEST` 4 of 4;
- `DXTTEST` creating every format in every pool.

**A DDI 8 driver may leave out the pre-DP2 entries** (§4): 9x's
`d3d8.dll` drives ours through `DrawPrimitives2` alone. Doc 15's two
`GetDriverInfo2` negotiation traps apply unchanged.

**The failure shape to suspect first.** Everything black, every call
`S_OK`, and **no `ddi:` line** in the host log: the 9x layer computed
the command window as `vram_size - CURSOR_BYTES - SHM_SIZE` while the
device puts it at `vram_size - SHM_SIZE`, so batches went 16 KiB below
the window the executor reads. The layer now reads
`D3DPT_FB_REG_CMD_OFFSET`, as NT always did. With §19's constant and
§26's heap end, this is the track's recurring bug: **a value the layer
re-derives instead of reading from the one authority fails silently and
looks like something else.** When "the calls all succeed and nothing is
drawn", diff the layer against `nt/`.

**A 2ksbox Win98 machine runs DirectX 9.0c** (decision). The in-box 6.1
(`DDRAW.DLL` 4.06.03.0518, no `DirectDrawCreateEx`) is an older DDI
generation with no XP precedent and no pixel oracle (`D3D7TEST`'s DX7
path cannot run on it). On 9.0c the runtime is XP's, and our DX8 DDI
serves DirectX 3 through 8 through the runtime's own translation (DDI 9
would only add what doc 04 routes to M4's per-game `d3d9.dll`). So stock
Win98 gets the accelerated desktop and DirectDraw, and **Direct3D wants
DirectX 7 or later in the guest**. The DirectX 6 accommodations were
never taken on 9.0c and were deleted.

**Trap when updating an image.** Installing DirectX by hand means
booting on `-vga cirrus`, which rebinds the display to the in-box driver
and drops `D3DPT9V.VXD` from `[386Enh]`; `SYSTEM.INI` still says
`pnpdrvr.drv` while `[boot.description]` says Cirrus.
`win98-driver-test.sh <image> install` puts it back; `boot` does not.

## Real titles and screen switches

### 26. Real titles, and a pointer that lived in the frame buffer

The first titles on the driver (the user's `claude98`: Monster Truck
Madness, NFS Porsche 2000, Total Annihilation, LEGO Island, Crimson
Skies, Blood) found what no probe could. The harness,
`tools/win98-game-test.sh`, builds **the machine the player builds**
(`launcherx --print-args`: `-cpu pentium3`, the sound card, the disc on
`ide.1`): Total Annihilation with no sound card quits before a frame,
which reads exactly like the display driver failing. It re-stages the
driver each run (`NO_DRIVER=1` keeps the image's own).

#### The pointer must not live in the frame buffer

The DIB Engine draws its cursor **into VRAM** with a save-under, lifted
by `BeginAccess` / `EndAccess` around every GDI draw. **DirectDraw does
not go through GDI.** A game that locks the visible primary (Total
Annihilation, every frame) or flips writes over the cursor, and the next
mouse move stamps the stale save-under back ("the mouse is glitchy").
The flat 32-bit HAL cannot call the Engine's 16-bit exclusion pair.

So the pointer is the adapter's cursor sprite, as on XP (doc 15, "The
hardware cursor"). `SetCursor`, `MoveCursor` and `CheckCursor` are C in
`d3dpt9x.c`; a monochrome `CURSORSHAPE` becomes a8r8g8b8 below the
command window, and the host composites it.

- **`C1_COLORCURSOR` is claimed only without a sprite**, so a colour
  shape arrives in the screen's format. What the sprite cannot carry
  goes back to the Engine's software pointer, sprite taken off first, so
  there is always exactly one pointer.
- **`SetCursor` names two functions**: win16.h's API and the driver's
  ordinal 102. The driver hides the API's declaration during the
  headers, as for `ValidateMode` (§18).
- **No CRT, so no 32-bit multiply.** `(DWORD)y * stride` links an
  undefined `__U4M`. Use `MulW`.

A screendump shows no pointer (`d3dpt-vga: cursor 32x32 … defined` in
the log is the sprite); the player composites it when the pointer is
grabbed.

#### The other five

- **NFS Porsche's silence and the `dxdiag` crash** are not the driver:
  the Portuguese SB16 wave-in name overflows DirectX 9's DSOUND (doc 20
  §5.3).
- **Crimson Skies** is ours, not SafeDisc (§27, §28, §34).
- **The DirectDraw heap ran into the command window.** `d3dpt9dd.c`
  published `fpEnd` at the top of VRAM less the cursor, but the command
  window occupies the top 64 MB of the 128 MB aperture (the cursor
  image sits below it). The `.drv` now reads `D3DPT_FB_REG_CMD_OFFSET`
  (the NT core's `dd_heap_end()`), and `d3dpt9dd: heap=… ..=…` must end
  64 MB below the top. `dwVidMemTotal`/`Free` no longer count the window.
- **An 8 bpp mode came up with an uninitialised palette.** `Enable`
  programmed the device from the colour table past the PDEVICE before
  anything filled it. It now fills in Windows' default first (the twenty
  static colours, a 6-6-6 cube, a grey ramp).
- **A full-screen DOS box (Blood) needs the screen switch.** While
  `D3DPT_FB_REG_ENABLE` is set the device scans out the linear frame
  buffer and the DOS program's VGA writes never show. The mini-VDD
  answers four dispatch entries: `PRE_HIRES_TO_VGA` clears `ENABLE`,
  `POST_VGA_TO_HIRES` sets it, and the other two log. A real switch
  calls all four in order, with the driver's `RestoreDesktopMode`
  (registered through `VDD_DRIVER_REGISTER`) in the middle:

  ```
  d3dptvxd: hi-res -> VGA
  d3dptvxd: hi-res -> VGA done
  d3dptvxd: VGA -> hi-res
  d3dpt9x: RestoreDesktopMode
  d3dptvxd: VGA -> hi-res done
  ```

Two DOS-game failures look like the driver: a DOS/4GW EXE started from
`C:\` cannot find `dos4gw.exe` (`GUEST_CMD` takes several CRLF lines, so
`cd` first), and an image with no `SET BLASTER=` fails every DOS game's
sound probe. Judge a run only when it is over: an interim log of a
switch that has not come back reads as a one-way switch to black, so
diff the screendumps.

### 27. Crimson Skies: two binaries, and eliminations on the wrong screen

The install has two executables: `CRIMSON2.EXE`, the SafeDisc loader,
and `CRIMSON.EXE`, a no-CD patch the user runs. Check which binary a
report is about.

Against the Cirrus control (`VGA=cirrus`), the menu's logo and buttons
were solid white silhouettes on our adapter (the cause is §28). The
first eliminations were made on the opening splash, not the menu, and
say nothing about it. What stays useful:

- `gdiprobe.exe` checks each GDI raster operation's pixels with
  `GetPixel` (57 cases at 8/16/32 bpp; its 8 bpp failures are the
  probe's own palette quantisation). `setbpp.exe` sets the desktop depth
  from a batch file.
- **The game sets its own mode** (1024×768×16 here) whatever the
  desktop's depth, so bisecting depth via the desktop changes nothing.
- **Reinstalling the driver does not reset the desktop depth.**
  `install` on a machine already bound to this driver re-copies files
  without a PnP reinstall, and `CURRENT` survives. Change depth with
  `ChangeDisplaySettings` from inside the guest.

### 28. Crimson Skies: the legacy blend, and locked driver files

**The menu is Direct3D** (≈23 textured quads a frame through the DX7
HAL). The `D3DPT_DP2_TRACE` frame showed `COLOROP = SELECTARG2`, the
all-white diffuse, with the texture's alpha. The game sets the DirectX 5
`TEXTUREMAPBLEND` render state (`MODULATE`) **with no texture bound**,
then `COLORARG2`/`ALPHAARG2`, and binds textures per draw. The
executor's legacy-blend emulation decided "no texture: diffuse", and any
stage-0 state 1–6, the ARGs included, cleared its re-evaluate flag. It
now keeps one flag per op, ended only by the app's own `COLOROP` /
`ALPHAOP` (host side, `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_ddi.cpp`, shared with XP;
doc 15, "The white menu text"; `d3dpt-dp2-test` has the sequence). The
QUIT button's missing bottom half was §34's depth bug.

To drive it headless: `GUEST_CMD=$'cd C:\\ARQUIV~1\\MICROS~1\\CRIMSO~1\r\nCRIMSON.EXE'`,
`CDS=` the disc, the Select Video Device dialog's OK at 496,302 on an
800×600 desktop, clicked with `qmpc.py relclick` (it walks the PS/2
mouse, reading the position back from the adapter's cursor registers),
then Space to the menu.

#### Which driver files Win98 locks while running

| file | overwrite the running copy |
|---|---|
| `D3DPT9X.DRV` (held by GDI) | fails, locked |
| `D3DPT9V.VXD` (held by the VMM) | fails, locked |
| `D3DPT9HL.DLL` (loaded per game) | succeeds |

**The one that succeeds is the dangerous one.** 9x does not hold the
file while its pages are still demand-paged from it (as a `.drv`'s
discardable segments are reloaded from theirs), so a module replaced
underneath runs the new bytes at the old addresses and blue-screens, as
`SETUP /ALL` over an installed driver did at the restart prompt. So
SETUP's 9x driver step never overwrites a driver file that is already
there: it stages each as `NAME.EX_` and swaps it with `WININIT.INI
[rename]` at the restart. The doubled `/ALL` in
`tools/setup-guest-test.sh` guards it.

### 29. Leaving a DOS box, the blue screen, and the pointer over both

#### The exit was not a hang: nobody repainted the desktop

After a full-screen DOS box (Blood) the mini-VDD put the *adapter* back,
but the screen stayed on the game's last frame, tiled, with the VGA
planes as a band on top, while `info registers` twice showed an idle,
healthy guest (EIP moving, `HLT=1`). **What puts the *desktop* back is
INT 2Fh AX=4001h (`SCREEN_SWITCH_OUT`) / AX=4002h (`SCREEN_SWITCH_IN`)**,
which the main VDD raises in the Windows VM and every display driver
hooks in `Enable`:

- On the way out, set `BUSY` in the DIB Engine's PDEVICE so GDI stops
  drawing: the desktop's frame and the DOS program's VGA memory are the
  same bytes from VRAM offset 0.
- On the way back, restore the mode if still `BUSY` and call **USER's
  repaint entry, ordinal 275** (undocumented, via `GetProcAddress`),
  which sends every window's WM_PAINT after a full-screen session.
  `DISPLAY.500` (`UserRepaintDisable`) defers it.

The handler is `_SWHook` in `dibthunk.asm`; the callbacks are in
`d3dpt9x.c`. The saved vector lives in the code segment (no DS needed),
written through an alias from KERNEL's `AllocCStoDSAlias` (KERNEL.170,
by ordinal) because code segments are read-only. The driver has one code
segment (`_TEXT`, `preload fixed`), which avoids §13's empty-`_TEXT`
trap. The log reads `switched out` just after `hi-res -> VGA done` and
`switched in` just after `VGA -> hi-res done`.

#### The big pointer: a sprite over a screen that has no cursor

Without `seamless_mouse` the player composites the cursor sprite into
the guest frame, which during a DOS game was the game's VGA screen: a
big pointer at desktop coordinates. `d3dpt-vga` now reports the sprite
hidden whenever `ENABLE` is off (`fb_cursor_move` gates on it, and every
`ENABLE` write re-runs it), and a reset drops the shape. That also
covers XP's full-screen console and both families' blue screens.
**Never `dpy_cursor_define(con, NULL)`**: QEMU's console takes a
reference unconditionally, so NULL is a SIGSEGV in the player. "No
cursor" is a hidden 1×1 transparent one (`fb_cursor_clear`). A Windows
restart on the device (`GUEST_CMD='RUNDLL32 SHELL32.DLL,SHExitWindowsEx
2'`) is the check.

#### The blue screen is drawn by the VDD

A 9x blue screen (fatal exception, protection error, Ctrl+Alt+Del,
"It is now safe to turn off your computer") is *message mode*: the VMM
stops the world and the main VDD programs VGA text mode itself. The
adapter has to leave its linear mode for it, and three roads reach the
mini-VDD:

- **A fault in a VM's own execution** takes the ordinary switch
  (`switched out`, `hi-res -> VGA`), so `PRE_HIRES_TO_VGA` clears
  `ENABLE` (§26).
- **`SAVE_MESSAGE_MODE_STATE`** (function 45) is called once at boot,
  and the mini-VDD clears `ENABLE` there too. `ddk9x/minivdd.h` has the
  numbering, which past 43 differs from older write-ups.
- **A fault outside any VM** (a timer or event callback) sends no switch
  at all; patch 44's corrupted `uint16_t` slot list
  (`patches/qemu/README.md`, `44-tlb-retire`) put up invisible VTDAPI
  screens this way. Every message screen does send the VMM's
  `Begin_Message_Mode` (0x10) / `End_Message_Mode` (0x11) to every VxD.
  The first clears `ENABLE`, remembering whether it was set; the second
  sets it again only if it was.

`tools/win98-bsod-test.sh` blue-screens a copy on purpose through our own
`BSODVXD.VXD` and `BSODTMR.VXD` (`docs/testing.md`). A trigger a test
depends on has to be something we ship: `con\con` is patched on the test
image, and a fault in a DOS box only ends the DOS box. The mini-VDD logs
the first calls of every other dispatch entry (`vdd fn=…`). Around a
switch the VDD also calls `RESTORE_REGISTERS`, `ACCESS_VGA_MEMORY_MODE`,
`ENABLE_TRAPS`, `MAKE_HARDWARE_NOT_BUSY` and `DISABLE_TRAPS`, none of
which needs an answer.

Total Annihilation's reported crash on exit did not reproduce from its
main menu, and its exit from inside a skirmish is fixed too (user,
2026-09-23).

### 30. Carmageddon: a heap overrun at 16→8 bpp, and DirectDraw's own Mode X

**The PDEVICE is sized once, at boot.** `Enable` reserved the 8 bpp
colour table (256 `RGBQUAD`s) in `dpDEVICEsize` only when the *current*
mode was 8 bpp, but GDI allocates the display PDEVICE once from the boot
depth and `ReEnable` reuses it. A game switching a 16 bpp desktop to
8 bpp wrote 1 KiB past the block: blue screens in a different VxD each
run (VTDAPI, VSB16, KERNEL32), the signature of scribbled shared memory.
The table is reserved at every depth now. `ddprobe.exe <w> <h> <bpp>
[sys] [modex] [vga] [hold]` reproduces it without the game.

**A 320×200 game wants Mode X, not a driver mode.** Carmageddon asks
`SetCooperativeLevel(0x53)` (with `DDSCL_ALLOWMODEX`), `SetDisplayMode(320,
200, 8)` and a `PRIMARYSURFACE | FLIP | COMPLEX | SYSTEMMEMORY` chain,
the DirectX SDK's Mode X recipe. For a 320×200 request the driver does
not list, the runtime switches the display driver out (GDI `Disable`,
`VDD_DISPLAY_DRIVER_DISABLING`), programs the VGA and DAC itself and
copies the system-memory chain into planar VGA memory at every `Flip`.
Our driver listed 320×200 and 320×240 and set `DDHALINFO_MODEXILLEGAL`,
so the game got a linear mode with a system-memory primary that nothing
presents: black, palette correct. **The driver lists no 320-wide mode
and leaves the flag clear**, as the reference does. The VGA core then
reports Mode X (`cr1=4f cr7=1f cr9=41 cr12=8f sr4=06`) and the game
draws. (On the Cirrus a DCI primary *is* the screen, so it always
worked there.)

While the linear mode is off the device logs the VGA core's mode
registers once per change (`d3dpt-vga: vga core cr1=… sr4=…`), which is
how a headless run tells Mode X, 13h and a blue screen's text mode apart.

Also from this section:

- **The held frame after `ENABLE` goes 0** (so a mode switch's reset
  does not flash the VGA core) is `D3DPT_FB_VGA_GRACE_MS`, wall clock.
  Counted in display refreshes it lasted 45 s on a headless console.
- **`CS=F000 EIP=D40F` in V86 mode is SeaBIOS's interrupt stub `iret`**,
  where an idle Windows 98 spends its time. A machine ignoring the power
  button because a full-screen DirectDraw process holds it is not dead.
- **Known limitation.** A system-memory *flipping* primary in exclusive
  full-screen on a *driver* mode blocks its process inside `Flip`'s
  `DDFLIP_WAIT` for a present the runtime never completes (`DDPROBE 640
  480 8 sys` is the repro); declining the flip only moved the block. No
  shipped title reaches it: 320×200 is Mode X, and 640×480 titles use a
  video-memory primary.
- `ddprobe`'s log reopens after every line; otherwise a blue screen
  leaves a 0-byte `DDPROBE.LOG` (the FAT entry's size is never written).

### 31. 3DMark 99: the emulator, not the driver

3DMark 99 on the driver scored 3334 under TCG with **DXVK, RADV and the
executor under 0.3 % of QEMU**: a Win98 3D title's time is the guest CPU.
The work that followed is TCG's (`patches/qemu/README.md`, patches 35–39
and 42–45; doc 22; the M9 track). The one host-side change: a DX7
indexed draw passed `MinVertexIndex`, so DXVK copied every batch's
unused prefix (32 GB a run); the executor now rebases it to the touched
range.

Two driver-side notes. The HAL's byte-loop `memcpy` (both families now
link `kcrt.c`'s `rep movsd`) changed nothing measurable: its profile
samples were the TB walks' cost landing on its stores, so A/B before
crediting a profile. And with the vertical blank off (`ddflags=32768`) a
title runs past 60 flips/s; the pacing stays on for games (doc 15, "The
flip chain's vertical blank").

### 32. A read of the whole driver

A review of all three 9x binaries and the shared core, each finding
checked against the other side of its boundary:

**The HAL (`w9x/d3dpthal.c`)**

- **The core's memory comes from a `HEAP_SHARED` heap** (9x kernel32
  only, `0x04000000`). Every pointer to it lives in the DLL's shared
  data (§23), so a per-process heap let the next Direct3D process free
  another's block. The log says so if the heap lands below 2 GiB.
- **`DDHAL_GETDRIVERSTATEDATA` has the DDK's layout** (it had four
  invented fields and wrote `ddRVal` 12 bytes past the structure).
- **The destroy callbacks release only a handle the surface has**, never
  one from the DX3-era surface counter, which starts at 101 in the
  runtime's own range and could drop a live texture.
- **The command-window lock is per thread**, and every surface
  registration takes it. `ContextDestroyAll32` breaks a lock left by a
  process that died inside a callback (`cmd_lock_break`); a fault the
  process survives still leaks it (§36).
- `GetVerticalBlankStatus` reports the blank (doc 15, "The flip chain's
  vertical blank").

**The core (both families)**

- **A blit after a draw goes in a record of its own.** TEXBLT, BUFFERBLT
  and VOLUMEBLT copy during the walk while the host reads resources when
  it runs a draw, so one record would give every draw the last blit's
  bytes; `dp2_run` cuts the stream before a blit that follows a draw.
  No runtime yet needs it (both d3d8.dlls end the DP2 call before such a
  blit; `MGDTEST` passes on the unfixed core too).
- **Long non-indexed draws are cut** into pieces of at most 0x10000
  vertices (lists on a primitive, strips overlapping, triangle strips on
  an even triangle; a fan still skips). The caps allow 0xffff primitives
  and the host used to skip such a draw whole. Confirmed by a title
  (user, 2026-09-23).
- Stream 0's stride is bounded at 1024. TEXBLT rectangles on mip levels
  round up, and a DXT rectangle starts at its block. A DP2
  `SETRENDERTARGET` becomes the context's readback target.

**The mini-VDD.** Selector limits were one page long. The way back from
a DOS box re-enables the linear mode only if the switch found it on
(not under the 16-colour drivers, not after `PhysicalDisable`). The
notification log's counter no longer wraps.

**The `.drv`.** Two inline-asm VDD calls now declare the registers they
clobber, and a refused `ReEnable` restores the mode globals.

**Checked and left alone.** GDIINFO's English/twips extents look wrong,
but 98's GDI builds mapping modes from `LOGPIXELS` (all five right on
the unfixed driver). The DX3 bounce's parser pointer is machine-wide
(right while system DLLs load at one base). Two mini-VDD failure paths
leak arena pages. VOLUMEBLT refuses DXT volumes (never seen sent).

### 33. Diablo II's sheared menu: one pitch rule for a mode

The shareware demo's menu at 800×600×8 was smeared into streaks.
DirectDraw sizes a flip chain's back buffers with the pitch rounded up to
the HAL's advertised alignment (64), so the back buffer's pitch was 832
while the mode was scanned at 800, and each flipped line landed 32 bytes
further along. 800 is the one 8 bpp width in the table that 64 does not
divide (so is 400×300 at 8 and 16 bpp). NT's miniport rounds every mode
to 32 and advertises 32, so it never had the bug.

**`D3DPT9X_PITCH(w, bpp)`** (`w9x/d3dpt9x.h`), bytes per line rounded up
to `D3DPT9X_PITCH_ALIGN` (64), is now the only pitch. It sets GDI's
`dwPitch` (and so `deWidthBytes`, the VDD registration, `lDisplayPitch`),
the HAL mode table `SetMode32` programs, both VRAM-fit checks, and
`dwOffscreenAlign`; 800×600×8 scans at 832. The guard is the `pitch
check:` line of `ddprobe <w> <h> <bpp>`, comparing the flipping
primary's pitch with its back buffer's.

The game was on DirectDraw only because of a Blizzard bug: the
shareware's `D2VidTst` saves the renderer under `...\Diablo II
Shareware\VideoConfig` and the game reads `...\Diablo II\VideoConfig`.
Setting that key's `Render` to 3 puts it on Glide (the Voodoo 2, doc 21).

### 34. Crimson Skies in flight: a Z buffer reset through a Lock

In flight "almost everything is transparent, some pieces leave trails";
of 454 draws a frame, only the HUD changed a pixel. The game uses
reversed depth (`ZFUNC GREATEREQUAL`, far = 0) and **resets its Z buffer
by Locking it (`DDLOCK_WRITEONLY`) and writing 0** every frame, with no
`Clear2` and no depth-fill blit, so the host's depth buffer kept the
previous frame and everything farther failed. (`pmemsave` over QMP at
BAR0 + the Z surface's offset shows the zeros.) The same bug cut §28's
QUIT button in half.

**The fix** is in the shared core (`core/core_ctx.c`, `d3d_z_written`).
Each layer remembers a Z buffer locked for writing (`Unlock32` on 9x,
`DdUnlock` on XP). On its Unlock, if the buffer holds one value, that
value becomes a Z-only clear on every context using it. The core reads
it through `dwZBitMask` and converts it to [0, 1] with integers only,
because XP's driver is kernel code that may not touch the FPU. A
read-only lock and a non-uniform buffer are left alone (there is no
depth-image upload). The scan costs guest CPU every frame, so it samples
every 7th row and the last, about 15 % of the buffer (user decision). Z
locks are logged separately (the first 16, then every 1024th) with the
core's decision.

A DirectDraw depth fill (`Blt(DDBLT_DEPTHFILL)`) does not reach the
driver either: claiming `DDCAPS_BLTDEPTHFILL` alone leaves the runtime
filling through a Lock (which this now catches), and `DDCAPS_BLT` needs
SRCCOPY and a real blitter (§21). A fill of *part* of the buffer is
lost. XP had the same gap and has the same fix.

**The guard is `ZFILLTEST.EXE`** (`guest-tools/src/d3dptvid/zfilltest.c`,
built for both families). It clears Z to 1.0, then runs a depth fill of
0, a fill of 0xffff and a Lock writing 0, each followed by a z 0.5 quad
under GREATEREQUAL that it reads back. All pass with the fix; the old
driver fails the fill-0 and Lock cases on both families.

```sh
STAGE=guest-tools/out/driver9x/zfilltest.exe PULL=2KSBOX\\ZFILLTEST.LOG \
  GUEST_CMD=$'cd C:\\\r\nZFILLTEST.EXE' tools/win98-game-test.sh <image> zf
tools/xp-driver-test.sh <overlay> cmd 'D:\DRIVER\ZFILLTEST.EXE & copy C:\2KSBOX\ZFILLTEST.LOG E:\'
```

#### The menu text: a texture cap, read before any call

The Instant Action page drew every string as the engine's 8×8
"missing texture" pattern: the textures were never created and nothing
was refused, so the game had decided from the caps. `DEVCAPS.EXE`
(`w9x/devcaps.c`) dumps every DirectDraw device including non-display
ones, its DDCAPS, available memory per kind, and every
`D3DDEVICEDESC7`. Diffed against the Voodoo 2's DirectX 7 driver, it
showed 3dfx claiming `D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2` where we claimed any size.
With POW2 the game makes 3 814 power-of-two textures on that screen
instead of 218, and the text draws.

The core claims **`D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2 |
D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL`** (as GeForce 2–4 and Radeons do),
not POW2 alone, which would refuse every title a non-power-of-two
texture. The host has no such limit; the claim is for the titles. `ddflags=0x2` (`DDF_TEX_ANYSIZE`) is the old answer, and
`ddflags=0x20000000` (`DDF_TEX_256`) caps textures at 256×256 like a
Voodoo 2. The DX7/DX8 max texture aspect ratio is published as 4096
(it was 0; `D3D7TEST` refuses less than 8).

### 35. The shutdown screen's green band: the linear mode went off too late

"Windows is shutting down" sometimes showed the desktop with a bright
green band on top for a quarter of a second, which only the player
catches (`PLAYER=1 PLAYER_SHOT_EVERY=6` on `tools/win98-game-test.sh`),
never one-a-second screendumps. A 16 bpp desktop is shown through the
adapter's shadow copy, updated only while `ENABLE` is 1; the held frame
(§30) is that copy. `PhysicalDisable` unregistered from the VDD before
writing `ENABLE = 0`, and the unregister is where the VDD sends
`DISPLAY_DRIVER_DISABLING` (function 26) and starts writing the VGA
planes from VRAM offset 0. A refresh inside those 12 ms took them into
the held frame.

**The fix is the order, twice.** `PhysicalDisable` writes `ENABLE = 0`
before `VDD_DRIVER_UNREGISTER`. The mini-VDD answers
`DISPLAY_DRIVER_DISABLING` itself (`driver_disabling_proc`) by turning
the linear mode off and forgetting any switch or message screen in
flight, since the way back from a disable is the driver's own `Enable`.
The log reads `linear mode off`, then `d3dptvxd: display driver
disabling`.

To drive a Portuguese Win98 shutdown by keys: `ctrl+esc`, `up`, `ret`,
`ret` (`d` selects "Documentos" first). A machine with the Voodoo 2 needs
`EXTRA="-device voodoo2"` in the harness, or Windows finds new hardware.

### 36. 3DMark2001 SE's demo: a freed surface, a swallowed fault, a lock left held

The demo froze on black after its loading screen, one thread spinning
in `DestroySurface32` → `cmd_lock_acquire` (`Sleep(0)`) on a lock held
by a **blocked** thread. That thread had faulted in our HAL inside
`DrawPrimitives2`: `surf_colorkey_check` read the colour key off a kept
`SURF::lcl` pointer at every bind, and the runtime had freed and reused
that surface LCL. A handler in the game's thread swallowed the fault,
and the lock was never released.

**The core keeps no pointer to an OS surface** (§19). Registration takes
the key off the descriptor (`surf_key_snapshot`), and a later key arrives
through `SetColorKey` → `surf_colorkey_set` (both layers claim the
colour-key caps). The one thing lost is a key removed without a
`SetColorKey` call. `TextureGetSurf32` (DirectX 5 texture handles) keeps
its own list, filled by `TextureCreate32` and emptied by
`TextureDestroy32`. The demo now plays to the end, and XP's `CKTEST`
still passes 4 of 4.

**Still open, accepted for v1** (user decision): any fault inside a
callback leaks the command-window lock and freezes the session until the
process dies. The fix is an exception frame that releases the lock on
unwind, turning the next such bug into one failed call.

### 37. 3DMark2001 SE's white sky, ground and coat: no surface wider than the screen

Surfaces drew white where d3d8.dll bound **texture handle 0**: the
runtime had no video-memory copy of those managed textures, all 1024
wide at a 640×480 desktop. **Windows 9x DirectDraw puts no surface wider
than the primary into video memory unless the driver claims
`DDCAPS2_WIDESURFACES`.** NT's driver always claimed it; the 9x
`d3dpt9dd.c` does now. A draw sampling a stage with handle 0 bound is
this symptom (§39 again).

The Lobby's frame rate under its debris physics was the guest's x87 at
PC=64, answered in doc 13 (patches 47–49).

### 38. 3DMark2001 SE's Nature: "device does not support bump normal maps"

3DMark's driver DLL probes six bump formats with `CheckDeviceFormat`,
and "normal" is **Q8W8V8U8** or W11V11U10. Q8W8V8U8 has no DDPIXELFORMAT,
so d3d8.dll creates it as a **FOURCC surface whose code is the
D3DFORMAT, 63**. DirectDraw refuses a FOURCC not in the driver's list
before any callback, which is also why XP's d3d8.dll made no video-memory
copy of it (doc 15). Both layers list FOURCC 63 now and size such a
surface (`fmt_fourcc_rows`), and the host takes it as `R8G8B8A8_SNORM`.
BUMPTEST passes 10 of 10 on Win98 and the whole 3DMark2001 SE benchmark
runs to its score. **The NT half is not measured**, because
`xp-driver-test.sh install` installed no driver on the `winxp-m7` overlay
(open in `docs/00-status.md`).

### 39. 3DMark2001 SE's Pixel Shader ocean drew black: no cube map in video memory

The ocean's ps 1.1 reflection (`texm3x3vspec t3`) sampled stage 3 with
handle 0 bound (§37's symptom). The cube existed only as the runtime's
system-memory copy (`cube … not mirrored … (system memory)` in the log).
**9x DirectDraw creates a cube map in video memory only if the driver
claims `DDSCAPS2_CUBEMAP` in `DDMORESURFACECAPS.ddsCapsMore`**, answered
through `GetDriverInfo` for `GUID_DDMoreSurfaceCaps`. NT's dxg never asks
for it; the 9x layer now answers. `ddflags=0x400000` (`DDF_NO_CUBE`)
withholds it along with the cube caps. CUBETEST passes 9 of 9 on Win98.

## No executor

### 40. `no-exec` on 9x: the HAL claimed a Direct3D it did not have

With `-global d3dpt-vga.no-exec=on` (a host with no executor, doc 15)
`d3d_init` refuses, but `DriverInit` published the Direct3D globals and
callbacks anyway, and the `.drv` claimed `DDCAPS_3D` and the 3D surface
caps over a `D3DHAL_GLOBALDRIVERDATA` of zeros. The HAL now gates all of
it on `core.d3d`, as NT always did, and logs `d3dpthal: no Direct3D on
this host, DirectDraw only`. `NO_EXEC=1 tools/win98-driver-test.sh
<image> boot` checks for that line, for no `d3d global=`, and for
DDPROBE's DirectDraw half intact. A DirectX 3–6 title then uses its
software renderer through the flip chain (Moto Racer: 299 flips in 5 s).

- **Moto Racer without its disc crashes, executor or not**: it recurses
  until its stack is gone (a stack fault in KERNEL32 or `MOTO.EXE`).
  Check the disc before the driver.
- **`lpSetInfo` can go stale.** It points into DDRAW16, loaded only
  while some process has DirectDraw open, and the driver calls it from
  `Enable` at every mode set. `DDNEWCALLBACKFNS` with a null table takes
  it back, so the driver clears it and checks the selector with `lar`
  before any call.

### 41. The monitor power-down: the screen is taken away, and the linear mode stayed on

Left idle, a machine showed a frozen desktop with §35's green band. The
log's last line was `d3dpt9x: switched out` with no mini-VDD call after
it, and a key brought the desktop back. **Windows' monitor power-down
reaches the driver as a screen switch and nothing else**: INT 2Fh
AX=4001h. `SwitchToBgnd` marks the PDEVICE `BUSY` and the desktop
freezes (§29), while the mini-VDD hears nothing and `ENABLE` stays on,
scanning out a stale frame with the VGA planes through its top 20 rows.
A power-down asks `Control` about escapes 0xc01 and 0x27 only, never
`SETPOWERMANAGEMENT` (0x1804), so there is no DPMS request to answer.

**The fix.** `SwitchToBgnd` writes `ENABLE = 0`, so an unannounced
switch leaves the screen to the VGA core; in an announced one the
mini-VDD has already done it. `SwitchToFgnd` restores via
`RestoreDesktopMode` as before. The test is `PWRPROBE.EXE`
(`w9x/pwrprobe.c`, `docs/testing.md`), which broadcasts
`SC_MONITORPOWER` on demand; an idle wait depends on the image's power
scheme and proved nothing in 12 minutes.

**Still open**: an ACPI **standby** suspends the whole VM (QEMU
`SUSPEND`), and on wake nothing reprograms the adapter: a blank 720×400
text page, and the machine idles back into standby. The player does not
report `SUSPEND`/`WAKEUP` (`player/src/qmp.rs::is_notable`).

### 42. On 9x a DLL beside a game reaches only the session's first DirectDraw program

**On 9x the `DDRAW.DLL` beside a game is used only if that game is the
first program in the Windows session to touch DirectDraw.** Win9x keeps
one module per *name* machine-wide, and `DDHELP.EXE` keeps DirectDraw
resident, so from the second DirectDraw program on the system serves
`ddraw.dll` whatever is in the folder. Measured with the since-retired
WineD3D-in-guest copy, one binary in one folder under `no-exec=on`:
first in the session, `D3D7TEST` got `Wine D3D7 T&L HAL` and rendered;
after `DDPROBE` ran from elsewhere, it got this driver's `HAL caps
00000480 (no 3D)` and no HAL device. XP resolves by full path per
process and does not have the problem, which is why `xp-fifa2000.bat`
renames that image's leftover files *away*.

Two ways round it that don't work: replacing `WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DDRAW.DLL`
(System File Protection objects at the next login, which also blocks
`WIN.INI`'s `run=`, and restores it from `SYSBCKUP`), and preloading a
copy at login (an app-directory module never becomes the machine's,
even while resident). What works is redirecting the module *name*:
`KnownDLLs` is read per `LoadLibrary`, so a value written mid-session
holds for every program started after it:

```
[HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\KnownDLLs]
"DDRAW"="ddrawme.dll"
```

### 43. WineD3D as the machine's DirectDraw: removed

Until 2026-09-23 `SETUP /I 7` ("WineD3D as this machine's DirectDraw")
used §42's redirection to make WineD3D-in-guest the whole 9x machine's
DirectDraw: wine9x's switcher as `DDRAWME.DLL`, the machine's own
`DDRAW.DLL` kept as `DDSYS.DLL` with the name inside it patched, the GL
pass-through installed as the system `OPENGL32.DLL` (WineD3D draws
through the first one the loader finds, and redirecting that name
through `KnownDLLs` left it with no GL adapter), and `D3DPRE.EXE` in the
Run key deciding at every login which way `KnownDLLs\DDRAW` pointed, by
asking the driver whether the host had an executor. ADR-018 retired the
stack and M15 step 6 removed all of it in one commit; the design and
its test (`tools/wined3d-sys-test.sh`, three boots) are in the history
before that commit. What stays is the driver's private escape
(`D3DPT_ESC_HOSTINFO`, `d3dpt_esc.h`, answered from
`D3DPT_FB_REG_D3D_STATUS`), a diagnostic for any program that must know
before DirectDraw loads whether the host has an executor.

### 44. The frame a front-buffer flush presents

Under the retired fallback (§43), FIFA 2000 (and §40's Moto Racer)
played audio over a black screen. **Wine's ddraw presents the primary by
drawing into `GL_FRONT` and flushing. It never swaps**, and the embed
backend published frames only on a swap on Linux and Windows (macOS had
the hooks). Mesa accepts `glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT)` on a pbuffer with no
error, so nothing complained. The buffer hooks are now shared in
`embed/mglcntx_embed.c` (`install_buffer_hooks`); doc 12 has the design.
On the game: 206 frames with the hooks, 29 ending black without.
`embed-3d` (`tools/embed-3d-test.c`) guards it with no guest, and any
GL program that presents by a front-buffer flush needs it still.
