# 2. Architecture: in-process QEMU, player + launcher, process model

How the pieces fit: QEMU linked into the player, the launcher beside
it, the threads, the languages and the repository. The embed API itself
is doc 11, the display pipeline doc 03, the launcher and packaging
doc 07, and the rationale for every decision doc 10.

Three locked decisions shape it: QEMU runs in-process with the
display (ADR-002), a standalone Rust player plus a launcher with no
RetroArch/libretro (ADR-005), and Rust wherever possible (ADR-004).

## Why in-process

Framebuffer, input and audio must not cross a process boundary. Linking
QEMU as a library gives zero-copy framebuffer access, direct input
injection and one clock for pacing. The costs: one VM per process
(QEMU's global state and incomplete cleanup), a QEMU fork to maintain
(needed anyway for qemu-3dfx, the CD backend and our devices), and
GPL-2.0 for everything that links it.

```

- **A machine bundle** is a directory with `machine.toml` and usually
  its disk; discs sit on a shelf shared by every machine. The launcher
  turns a bundle into the player's command line; the player runs a QEMU
  command line and knows nothing of bundles (doc 07).
- One VM per player process, so a crashed guest never takes the library
  down and several machines run at once. For live control (snapshots,
  disc swaps) the launcher speaks QMP to a second monitor socket it adds
  at spawn; neither binary has an IPC channel of its own (doc 07, "How
  the launcher reaches a running machine").

## The embed boundary: `libqemu_embed.h`

A small C API on the QEMU fork (`embed/`, **v8**; the version history
and every call are doc 11): lifecycle from a plain `qemu-system`
command line, VM control, a 2D display listener and a 3D frame copy or
zero-copy ring (dma-buf on Linux, IOSurface on macOS), keyboard,
pointer and gamepad input, a caller-owned audio ring, and
`qemu_embed_socket_to_fd()` for the QMP socket on Windows. Media,
snapshots and status go over QMP. The Rust bindings in the
`qemu-embed` crate are hand-written (no libclang), and
`qemu_embed_api_version()` guards drift. The player never reaches past
this header.

## Language policy (ADR-004)

- **Rust:** the player, `qemu-embed`, `launcher-core`, `launcher-capi`
  and `launcher-qt`'s bridges (cxx-qt, with QML and a few small C++
  shims), `shader-chain`, `libdisc` (CD model and parsers, a staticlib
  with a C API for QEMU's ATAPI device), `libsynth` (the music engines,
  doc 20), `gamepad`, and host-side tools.
- **C/C++:** our QEMU patches and devices (embed, `d3dpt/`, `voodoo/`,
  `hw/audio` opl3/mpu401), the Direct3D executor, and the test
  harnesses in `tools/`.
- **Era C and assembly** for the guest side: the XP and Win9x display
  drivers, the guest DLLs, and the guest-tools programs.
- Python (uv-managed) for test drivers and helpers.

## Graphics stack

wgpu (Metal on macOS, Vulkan/D3D12 elsewhere) with **librashader's wgpu
runtime** for slang shaders, wrapped in the `shader-chain` crate that
the player and the launcher's preview share. librashader pins a wgpu
major (0.12 → wgpu 30) and the workspace follows that pin, not the
newest wgpu. Geometry updates are event-driven (`Gpu::guest_surface_changed`,
`Gpu::resize`).

## Threading model

- **QEMU main loop + vCPU threads**, QEMU-managed (MTTCG where TCG
  runs).
- **Render thread:** wgpu, librashader, present. The display listener
  (QEMU's main loop) only publishes a dirty rect into a triple-buffered
  handoff, or a ring slot index for 3D. QEMU never blocks on vsync; a
  slow host frame repeats the last guest frame.
- **Audio thread:** real time; cpal drains the ring QEMU's mixer fills.
- **Event thread:** winit; forwards input to QEMU without waiting.

Rule: no QEMU-owned thread waits on the GPU; no render or audio thread
takes a QEMU lock.

## Acceleration per platform

| Host | x86 guests | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | KVM (TCG fallback) | the performance reference |
| Windows x86_64 | WHPX (TCG fallback) | a bundle's `accel = "kvm"` is spelled `whpx` there |
| macOS Apple Silicon | TCG (MTTCG) | Win98 easy; XP at 104 % of a 1.7 GHz P4 with the TCG fast paths |
| macOS Intel | TCG | community build only: permitted, untested (ADR-019) |

Win98 machines default to TCG even where KVM exists (doc 07). macOS's
JIT needs the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` entitlement on the app
(`packaging/macos/2ksbox.entitlements`).

## Open questions

- **Host 3D texture sharing on Windows:** Linux and macOS are
  zero-copy (doc 12 §4); Windows still takes the CPU-copied frame, and
  a DXGI shared handle is open (M11).
- **QEMU cadence:** pinned to v9.2.4 plus a patch queue, built with only
  what is used (the `no-optionals` check). No rebase is scheduled.

In-process QMP is settled: a `socketpair` (a loopback pair on Windows),
standard QMP JSON, no filesystem path (doc 11).
