# Track M15: the Direct3D executor on Wine, on the host

The Direct3D fallback for a Linux or macOS host below DXVK's Vulkan 1.3
floor. The same paravirtual device and executor run on **Wine's d3d9
(WineD3D over OpenGL) in a Wine process on the host**, instead of a 2015
Wine copied into the guest beside every game (user, 2026-09-22: "running
an old unsupported Wine version in the guest is bad UX and doesn't make
sense"). ADR-018 is the decision and its rejected alternatives; doc 14
"The executor on Wine, in another process" is the design (the child, the
wire, the shared file). A Windows host uses its own d3d9 in process
instead (ADR-007's second amendment).

## Scope and files

- The child: `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_host.c` → `d3dpt-exec-host.exe`, a
  PE program that loads the Windows build of `d3dpt_exec.dll`.
- QEMU's side: `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec_remote.c` →
  `libd3dpt_exec_remote`, the wire `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_remote.h`, and the
  back-end choice in `d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_exec_load.[ch]`.
- The shared file behind device memory: `d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_vga.c` (VRAM,
  QEMU patch 73) and `d3dpt/hw/d3dpt_mm.c` (the SysBus window).
- Build and packages: `scripts/build-d3dpt-exec.sh --wine` (the PE pair
  into `build/d3dpt/wine/`), `scripts/build.sh`, `package-linux.sh`,
  `package-macos.sh --community`, the Flatpak manifest.
- Launcher: `launcher-core/src/host_gpu.rs` (`D3dBackend::Wine`, the
  third verdict), `wizard::Form::d3d9_note()`, and
  `player/src/companions.rs` (`wine`, `wine-host`, `d3dpt-remote`).
- Tests: the `exec-wine` check, the `EXEC=` knob of
  `tools/xp-driver-test.sh`, `tools/xp-fifa-match.sh` and
  `tools/tcg-profile.sh`, and `tools/macvm-wine-spike.sh` /
  `tools/macos-wine-spike-local.sh`.
- Shared, not edited: `d3dpt/exec/d3dpt_exec.cpp` needs nothing for Wine
  (the `system` branch's hidden window and executor-owned scene are what
  wined3d wants); `d3dpt/d3dpt_proto.h`.
- **Removed in step 6** (2026-09-23): all of WineD3D-in-guest (the
  wine9x build in `guest-tools/build-wrappers.sh`, `patches/wine9x/`,
  the ISO's `WINED3D\` folders, `SETUP /GAME 4`/`5` and `/I 7`,
  `guest-tools/src/d3dpre.c`, `tools/xp-wined3d-test.sh`,
  `tools/wined3d-sys-test.sh`). A below-floor host with no Wine has no
  Direct3D pass-through.

## State

Built and working end to end on the M1 Air, and accepted (step 5) on a
real macOS 15: the user ran the packaged community app there on
2026-09-23 and reported that it "works wonderfully". No frame rate was
written down for that run. Step 6, the removal of WineD3D-in-guest,
landed the same day. Measured numbers are in doc 14 under the Wine
section.

- **Host tests.** `d3dpt-dp2-test` and `d3dpt-exec-test` through the
  child are byte-identical to in-process DXVK, under Rosetta (WineHQ
  11.17) and on a real macOS 15.8 on the M1's GL (328 fps,
  user-confirmed). The `exec-wine` check holds it.
- **XP guest.** D3DGAME8 within the rig budget (600 frames in 3.4 s
  against 2.1 s in process); the ten DX8 DDI probes give the in-process
  verdicts; FIFA 2000 plays a match at 22.6 frames/s against 19.0.
- **Win98 guest.** D3D7TEST through the 9x HAL, 300 frames at 57 fps,
  byte-identical to `dp2-test.bmp`.
- **Launcher and packages.** The third verdict works, `--host-check`
  exits 0 through Wine, and `--paths` / `--companions` list the Wine and
  the pair. The Linux package and the macOS community build carry
  `libd3dpt_exec_remote` + the PE pair (all or none). No package ships a
  Wine; the note says which to install.
- **The community app on a real macOS 15** boots the XP machine to its
  desktop on the Wine executor through the packaged pair (`linear mode
  on (800x600x16)` at 25 s, `Direct3D executor in another process
  (Wine), ready`), after two fixes: the realize crash (Traps) and the
  launcher probing no Vulkan (`docs/build-macos.md` "The app").
  `build/macos-community/` is rebuilt with both.

## Rejected alternatives

The first three are ADR-018's; listed so nobody re-proposes them.

- **wined3d in process (winelib).** `d3d9.dll` and `wined3d.dll` are PE
  modules needing Wine's loader and a `wineserver`; a winelib binary *is*
  a Wine process.
- **An executor of our own over GL, Metal or wgpu.** A second D3D9
  implementation, which WineD3D already is.
- **Native arm64 Wine on macOS.** `winemac.drv` gets no OpenGL there.
  Revisit when Wine's Mac driver has Metal-backed GL.
- **Copying VRAM over the pipe.** The DDI path reads vertex buffers out
  of VRAM per draw and writes a readback per frame, so a copy is a round
  trip per draw.
- **A socket instead of stdio.** The child's two pipes are enough, and
  Wine's AF_UNIX support is recent.

## Test loop

The knobs (`D3DPT_EXEC`, the adapter's `exec=`, `D3DPT_WINE`,
`D3DPT_WINEPREFIX`, `D3DPT_EXEC_REMOTE_LIB`, `D3DPT_EXEC_HOST`,
`D3DPT_WINE_RENDERER`, `D3DPT_REMOTE_DIR`) are in `docs/development.md`,
the tools in `docs/testing.md`. On a host with Vulkan, `exec=wine` is the
A/B.

```sh
scripts/build.sh                  # the native stack, libd3dpt_exec_remote, and with mingw the PE pair
scripts/test.sh host              # exec-wine (SKIPs without a Wine or the pair)
build/qemu/qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ~/vms/winxp-m7.qcow2 -F qcow2 build/xp.qcow2   # never the image
tools/xp-driver-test.sh build/xp.qcow2 install                 # once: the image's driver predates 2026-09-12
EXEC=wine tools/xp-driver-test.sh build/xp.qcow2 d3dgame8      # the reference scene on Wine
EXEC=dxvk tools/xp-driver-test.sh build/xp.qcow2 d3dgame8      # the control
EXEC=wine tools/xp-driver-test.sh build/xp.qcow2 probes        # the ten DX8 DDI probes
EXEC=wine tools/xp-fifa-match.sh tcg build/xp.qcow2            # a real game
# the Win98 HAL: base98-us has a Voodoo 2, in the launcher's slot (addr=0x05)
STAGE=guest-tools/out/driver9x/d3d7test.exe PULL='2KSBOX\D3D7TEST.LOG 2KSBOX\D3D7TEST.BMP' \
  GUEST_CMD=$'start /w C:\\D3D7TEST.EXE 640 480 32 300' \
  EXTRA='-device voodoo2,addr=0x05 -global voodoo2.texmem=2 -global d3dpt-vga.exec=wine' \
  tools/win98-game-test.sh "<machines dir>/base98-us/disk.qcow2" d3d7wine
python3 tools/bmpdiff.py build/test/dp2-test.bmp build/w98game/d3d7wine/D3D7TEST.BMP --tolerance 8
```

**A pre-26 macOS** (the community build's user, ADR-019) cannot be
tested in a VM: Wine has no OpenGL there (`docs/build-macos.md` "The
app"; `tools/macvm-wine-spike.sh` shows it). The real one is a second
APFS volume on the Air with macOS 15. Boot into it and run
`tools/macos-wine-spike-local.sh` from the other volume's checkout in a
Terminal. A bare macOS 15 needs Rosetta (`softwareupdate
--install-rosetta --agree-to-license`); its Python is the Command Line
Tools stub, so the script falls back to uv's.

**Which Wine.** Linux: the distro's (`wine`/`wine64` on `PATH`). Mac:
WineHQ's tarball from Gcenx's releases, unpacked into `build/wine/` or
installed in `/Applications` (`docs/build-macos.md` "The app" has the
search order).

## Traps

- **Run `install` on an XP overlay first.** `winxp-m7.qcow2`'s driver
  (2026-09-08) predates the any-newer-version rule and refuses the
  adapter. XP falls back to VGA, D3DGAME8 dies in a modal box, and the
  killed guest loses its unflushed logs. The mode-set line after the
  restart proves the install.
- **XP with its display driver refused shows a black screen** on the
  adapter while BIOS text and mode 13h render: the VGA core sits in a
  chained 256-colour 800×600 mode (`sr4=0a gr5=50`) that draws nothing.
  Every screendump of a failed install run is black; read COM1.
- **wined3d's first batch stalls the vCPU** while it compiles shaders,
  so the child makes its device at probe time (doc 14). A 3.5 s stall
  inside an MMIO read reset the Win98 machine, and let patch 65 raise a
  quarter second of owed PIT ticks back to back into a VMM fault; the
  patch now paces the catch-up (`patches/qemu/README.md`, 65).
- **Carry `base98-us`'s Voodoo 2 in the launcher's slot** in a harness
  run. Without it 3dfx's login helper opens an "Error" box that takes
  exclusive mode (`DDERR_NOEXCLUSIVEMODE` at the first `BeginScene`); in
  another slot Windows finds new hardware and wants a restart.
- **Moto Racer is no Direct3D test on these images.** `winxp-m7`'s copy
  runs its software renderer, and on `base98-us` it takes the Voodoo 2.
- **QEMU must survive DXVK's probe on a host with no Vulkan** (doc 14
  "DXVK": ask for `libvulkan` first, never close a probed library) **and
  on a loader with no working device.** On macOS 15 KosmicKrisp reports
  no GPU, DXVK's constructor throws, and a second `Direct3DCreate9` on
  the same library faulted. DXVK patch 09 (`patches/dxvk/README.md`) and
  the executor's never-ask-twice rule fix it; `exec-no-device` checks
  the artefacts.
- **The shared-file path is POSIX-only** (doc 14, "The shared file").
  A future Windows out-of-process executor needs another mapping call.
- An overlay's absolute backing path does not exist on the other macOS
  volume. Flatten the image (`qemu-img convert`) for a run there.
- Homebrew's mingw links `libwinpthread-1.dll` dynamically (the Fedora
  cross image's does not), so the pair needs it beside the `.exe`.

## Steps

Numbered as ADR-018, doc 07 and CLAUDE.md cite them.

1. **The spike.** Done. Linux Wine on a real GL (the rig) is one
   `scripts/test.sh host` run away (`exec-wine`).
2. **The transport.** Done (doc 14). If a guest profile ever shows the
   pipe round trip, the answer is a bounded spin on a sequence word in
   the shared file before blocking.
3. **The guest.** Done on XP and Win98. Open: who programs the XP
   black-screen VGA mode (Traps) and why it draws nothing.
4. **The launcher and the packages.** Done (doc 07 has the verdicts).
5. **A real game on a below-floor host.** The acceptance, and what is
   left. The community app is built on the 26 side (`scripts/package-macos.sh
   --community --no-sign --no-dmg --out build/macos-community`; needs
   Homebrew, `macdeployqt` and the Vulkan SDK) with
   `build/xp-mac15.qcow2` (the XP overlay, flattened). Booted into
   macOS 15, in a Terminal:

   ```sh
   cd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD - Data/Users/david/work/win-98-xp-virt"
   cp -R "build/wine/Wine Staging.app" /Applications/   # once
   build/macos-community/2ksbox.app/Contents/MacOS/2ksbox --host-check
   #   "runs through Wine on this host (Wine 11.17, OpenGL)", exit 0: KosmicKrisp
   #   loads below 26 but reports no GPU, so DXVK finds no device and the third verdict is the one
   open build/macos-community/2ksbox.app
   #   an XP machine on a copy of build/xp-mac15.qcow2, Direct3D "auto";
   #   FIFA 2000 into a match
   ```

   It passes when the QEMU log says `exec: Direct3D executor in another
   process (Wine), ready`, the match draws on the M1's GL through the
   packaged pair, and its frame rate is written down against the Air's
   22.6. The reboot is the user's. **Passed on 2026-09-23**: the user
   ran the packaged app on the 15 volume and reported it "works
   wonderfully". The frame rate of that run was not written down; if it
   is ever wanted, it is the harness's count (`tools/tcg-fps.py`) on
   that volume against the Air's 22.6.
6. **Retire WineD3D-in-guest, in one commit.** Done on 2026-09-23: the
   ISO's `WINED3D\` folders and README, `SETUP /GAME 4`/`5` (the Glide
   sets are `/GAME 4` and `5` now), `/I 7` with `D3DPRE.EXE` and the
   `DDRAWME`/`DDSYS` switcher, the wine9x build and `patches/wine9x/`,
   `tools/xp-wined3d-test.sh` and `wined3d-sys-test.sh`, the launcher's
   WineD3D advice (a host with none is told to install Wine), doc 04's
   row, doc 19 §42–44 and CLAUDE.md's sentence. The 9x driver's
   `D3DPT_ESC_HOSTINFO` escape, which only the helper asked, stays as a
   diagnostic.
7. **The Flatpak's Wine add-on** (user decision, 2026-09-23: "go with
   the extension"). Flathub refuses a second listing of the same app, so
   there is no DXVK app beside a Wine app; and inside the sandbox the app
   cannot run the host's Wine (`flatpak-spawn --host` is a sandbox escape
   reviewers refuse), so the manifest's "the host's own Wine" never held
   there. The Wine is an **extension** of the app, listed on Flathub as
   its add-on:
   - `com._2ksbox.Launcher.Wine`, declared in the app manifest under
     `add-extensions` at `lib/2ksbox/wine` (`no-autodownload`,
     `autodelete`, `version` = the app's branch), the directory the
     tarball already uses for the PE pair. The app's Flatpak ships that
     directory empty.
   - Its own manifest, `build-extension: true` on `org.kde.Sdk` 6.10,
     builds a 64-bit Wine from source, modelled on Flathub's
     `org.winehq.Wine` (`stable-25.08`, the same freedesktop base; no
     gecko, no mono, the executor needs neither), plus the PE pair
     through `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.mingw-w64` (branch 25.08
     exists) with `scripts/build-d3dpt-exec.sh --wine`. Nothing is
     checked in as a binary.
   - The launcher and the C loader find it by one more fixed path in
     their `find_wine` (`host_gpu.rs`, `d3dpt_exec_remote.c`):
     `<prefix>/lib/2ksbox/wine/bin/wine`, after `D3DPT_WINE`. The pair
     is where `lib/2ksbox/wine/d3dpt-exec-host.exe` is looked for today.
   - `wine_install_hint()` in a sandbox (`/.flatpak-info` exists) says
     "Install the Wine add-on" and names it; doc 07's third verdict gets
     the sentence. `package-flatpak.sh` builds the extension too and its
     smoke check lists `wine` and `wine-host` in `--companions`.
   - Flathub: the extension is its own repo, submitted after the app,
     and shows on the app's page as an add-on.

## Rules

- One decoder for every back end (DXVK native, DXVK on Windows, the
  Windows system d3d9, Wine). Nothing Wine-specific goes into
  `d3dpt_exec.cpp`; a WineD3D quirk is answered in the child or written
  down.
- Every claim about a frame comes from a BMP in `build/` diffed with
  `tools/bmpdiff.py`.
- One TCG guest at a time; end scripted Win98 runs with the ACPI power
  button (CLAUDE.md).
