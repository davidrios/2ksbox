# Developer guide

The technical companion to the top-level `README.md`, which is for
people who *use* 2ksbox. This covers the build stage by stage, the
player's command line and environment, the launcher's front ends,
packaging, logs and licensing. Neighbours:

- `docs/00-status.md`: current state, open threads, next steps,
  cross-cutting gotchas. Read it first.
- `docs/testing.md`: the testing policy and every test tool.
- `CLAUDE.md`: the locked decisions and conventions in brief.
- `docs/tracks/`: one document per work track.
- `patches/qemu/README.md`: every QEMU patch.
- [build-macos.md](build-macos.md) and [build-windows.md](build-windows.md):
  the platform specifics.

## What exists vs. what we build

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| x86 emulation | Exists: a QEMU fork, trimmed to what we use, with our own TCG fast paths (x87, SSE, SIMD, REP strings, same-value SMC, inline TB lookup); KVM / WHPX on x86 hosts |
| Guest 3D | We build the paravirtual Direct3D device (`d3dpt`, a host executor on DXVK), qemu-3dfx's GL pass-through, OpenGLide as the host Glide wrapper, and an emulated Voodoo 2 (doc 21) |
| Guest display drivers | We build `d3dpt-vga` drivers for XP (miniport + DX8 DDI, doc 15) and Win98 (mini-VDD + 16-bit driver, doc 19); WineD3D in the guest is the fallback |
| Guest music | We build OPL3 and MPU-401 devices over `libsynth` (doc 20) |
| CRT shaders | Exists: libretro slang presets through librashader (a library, not RetroArch) |
| Player | We build it: in-process QEMU, wgpu + librashader, mode analysis, low-latency audio (Rust) |
| Launcher | We build `launcher-core`, shipped as `launcher-qt` (Qt 6 / QML via cxx-qt), and `launcher-capi` for other languages |
| CD-ROM backend | We build `libdisc` (cue/bin, subchannel, CD-DA, `isodir:` folders), the ATAPI patches, the disc shelf |
| Machine families | We build Win98, XP, DOS (throttled CPU rates) and Other |

Authentic-hardware emulation (a real S3, cycle-accurate chipsets) is
86Box's territory and out of scope. The exception is the Voodoo 2,
vendored verbatim from 86Box because only a real chip runs Glide 3 and
statically linked Glide titles (ADR-016).

## The build, stage by stage

`scripts/build.sh` is the one command, and the one to run after every
`git pull`; it redoes only what changed. `--help` lists the stages
(`qemu rust qt dxvk exec glide guest`). Naming stages builds only those,
`--test` follows with `scripts/test.sh host`, and a stage whose tools
are missing is skipped with the reason in the closing summary. What it
runs, for driving one stage by hand:

```sh
scripts/prepare-qemu.sh      # overlay qemu-3dfx + embed/, the patch queue, sign_commit
scripts/configure-qemu.sh    # uv-managed Python; also builds libdisc and libsynth
ninja -C build/qemu qemu-system-i386 qemu-img qemu-io libqemu-embed-i386.so   # .dylib on macOS
cargo build --release        # default members; the player links libqemu-embed
cargo check --release --workspace          # launcher-capi, the one non-default member
(cd launcher-qt && cargo build --release)  # the Qt launcher; its own workspace
# Direct3D pass-through (doc 14):
scripts/prepare-dxvk.sh && scripts/configure-dxvk.sh && ninja -C build/dxvk && scripts/build-d3dpt-exec.sh
# Glide pass-through (doc 12 §5):
scripts/prepare-openglide.sh && scripts/build-glide.sh
# the guest-tools ISO (SETUP.EXE, the guest DLLs, both display drivers):
guest-tools/build-wrappers.sh
```

What each stage needs to know:

- **Prepare steps are stamped.** A prepare re-applies its patch queue
  and hands the build system thousands of fresh mtimes, so running it
  every time costs a full QEMU rebuild. `build.sh` hashes each prepare's
  inputs into `build/.stamp-*` and skips it when they are unchanged;
  `-f` re-runs them all (after a tree was edited by hand, or a checkout
  moved). An overlay missing from a stamp's inputs is a trap (00-status,
  "Building").
- **`qemu/embed/` is an rsync copy of `embed/`** made by
  `prepare-qemu.sh`. A stale copy links the player against an old
  library: `undefined symbol _qemu_embed_…` (on macOS `Undefined symbols
  for architecture arm64: _qemu_embed_…`); `qemu-embed/build.rs` warns
  when the copy is stale. Bumping the embed API moves the header's
  `QEMU_EMBED_API_VERSION` and the crate's `API_VERSION` together.
- **Re-run `configure-qemu.sh` whenever meson files change**, and after
  a prepare, before `ninja`: a refreshed overlay can make ninja
  regenerate the build with default options, `werror` back on among
  them. `configure-qemu.sh` also builds `libdisc` (the CD-ROM model) and
  `libsynth` (the music engines), which link into QEMU (patches 50 and
  60).
- **`QEMU_PYTHON=<interpreter>`** makes `configure-qemu.sh` use that
  interpreter and never consult uv (3.8–3.13 enforced; 3.14 only with the
  real `distlib`). It is for a sandbox that has a Python and cannot fetch
  one, such as the Flatpak.
- **A `D3DPT_PROTO_VERSION` bump makes the executor and the guest-tools
  ISO stale, silently.** The suite fails as `d3dpt-dp2: protocol
  mismatch` and as a guest that never attaches. `build.sh` rebuilds
  both; on a host that cannot (no mingw), its summary names the
  artefacts left behind.
- **On macOS every stage targets Homebrew's floor**
  (`scripts/macos-floor.sh`). `build.sh` and `test.sh` export
  `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, QEMU and DXVK take it as a flag, and a
  cargo workspace linked for a newer macOS is cleaned first
  ([build-macos.md](build-macos.md), "The floor").
- A build belongs to one checkout. Never borrow another's `build/`,
  `target/` or `*_BIN` (00-status, "Building").

The player with no launcher:

```sh
target/release/player        # no arguments: the test pattern (integer-scaled 4:3)
target/release/player -- -L $PWD/qemu/pc-bios -machine pc -m 32 \
  -drive file=path/to/floppy.img,format=raw,if=floppy -boot a -vga std -net none
```

Everything after `--` is a `qemu-system-i386` command line. The player
adds `-display none` and `-audiodev embed,id=embed0` itself; attach the
audio with e.g. `-machine pc,pcspk-audiodev=embed0` or `-device
sb16,audiodev=embed0`. `launcherx --print-args <machine.toml>` gives the
exact line a launcher machine runs.

## The player: command line and environment

```
player [--shader <preset.slangp>] [--shader-params <k=v,...>]
       [--pad usb|gameport|keys] [--pads] [--pad-sweep <frames>]
       [--mode-sweep <dir>] [--calib <bmp|dir>] [--companions]
       [--] <qemu args...>
```

### Shaders

- `--shader <preset.slangp>` (or `PLAYER_SHADER=`) runs a libretro slang
  preset, e.g. `third_party/slang-shaders/crt/crt-lottes.slangp`;
  `shaders/README.md` has the curated ones.
- `--shader-params <name=value,...>` (or `PLAYER_SHADER_PARAMS=`)
  overrides the preset's parameter defaults by name
  (`BRIGHTBOOST=1.4,GAMMA_INPUT=2.4`). A launcher shader profile
  (`launcher-core/src/shader_profile.rs`) resolves to this.
- `--calib <bmp|dir>` shades doc 09's CRT calibration patterns
  (`build/crtcal-render` writes them) and exits.
- `--mode-sweep <dir>` runs doc 03's mode sweep instead of a guest and
  writes a PNG per mode. `PLAYER_MODE_PARAMS=0` is its control: the
  preset guesses the scanline count from the framebuffer height.

### Frames and dumps

- `PLAYER_DUMP=frame.png PLAYER_DUMP_SEQ=150` dumps guest frame 150 and
  exits.
- `PLAYER_DUMP_OUT=out.png` dumps the *shaded* frame (GPU readback) at
  `PLAYER_DUMP_SEQ` and exits, even while the window is occluded.
- `Ctrl+Alt+S` writes the guest's own frame (native size, no geometry
  stage, no CRT chain) as `PLAYER_SHOT_DIR/2ksbox-NNNN.png`, or in the
  working directory when that is unset.
- `PLAYER_SHOT_EVERY=300` takes that shot every 300 presented guest
  frames, driven from the wake path so a window behind a terminal still
  shoots. This is how a headless run sees a 3D frame; a QMP screendump
  shows the VGA surface, frozen while the 3D device presents.
- `PLAYER_REFRESH_MS=16` (default) is the guest frame pull interval
  (QEMU's own default is 30).
- `PLAYER_REFRESH_LOG=1` prints a frame counter every 100 guest frames:
  is the guest drawing at all.
- `PLAYER_LATENCY=1` prints publish→present latency percentiles every
  240 guest frames.
- `PLAYER_ZERO_COPY=0` refuses every dma-buf the backend offers, so 3D
  frames take the readback path instead of the ring (doc 12 §4). The
  readback copies under a lock, so a wrong picture that survives it is
  not the ring's.
- `PLAYER_PUBLISH_LOG=1` prints a line per published frame naming its
  source (which ring slot, the readback path, the VGA surface, the
  cursor's republish) and a line per presented frame. Two sources taking
  turns is a flicker the picture alone does not show. Pair the presented
  slot with `PLAYER_SHOT_EVERY=1`'s shots.
- `PLAYER_CURSOR_LOG=1` prints each change of the host cursor: default,
  hidden, or the guest's shape.

### Keys, pointer and window

- `PLAYER_KEYS="120:enter,360:ctrl+g"` presses keys or chords at guest
  frames, each held `PLAYER_KEYS_HOLD` frames (default 6, ~100 ms): a
  down+up in one flush is a zero-length press that a game polling the
  keyboard state never sees.
- `Ctrl+Alt+G` releases the grab. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D` is Ctrl+Alt+Del in
  the guest. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F` toggles borderless full screen on the
  window's monitor.
- A close with Alt held (Alt+F4 while the host has its shortcuts) asks
  first, in the window: Enter, Close or a second Alt+F4 stops the
  machine; Esc or Back returns to it. The title bar's close button does
  not ask.
- While the window has focus the host's shortcuts go to the guest, so
  the Windows key opens the guest's Start menu. The mechanism is
  Wayland's shortcut inhibitor, an X11 keyboard grab, or raw input with
  `RIDEV_NOHOTKEYS` on Windows (the two Windows keys, every Win+
  shortcut and Ctrl+Esc; Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, Ctrl+Alt+Del and Win+L are
  system hotkeys no program gets). macOS has none. `Ctrl+Alt+K` toggles
  them between host and guest (the title says when they are the
  host's). `PLAYER_KEYBOARD_CAPTURE=0` starts with them the host's;
  `scripts/test.sh` sets it. `PLAYER_KEYBOARD_LOG=1` prints what the
  Windows side did: whether the raw-input registration was accepted, and
  what winit and Windows each thought about focus at every change. A
  shortcut that still reaches the host is nearly always a window that
  was not in front. Design and measurements: doc 03 §"Input path",
  `player/src/kbcapture.rs`.
- `qemu-embed: input:` lines on stderr report the embed input queue's
  drain latency, zero-length presses and drops, only when something is
  off.

### Audio and music

- `PLAYER_AUDIO_MS=40` (default) is the cushion QEMU keeps in the ring
  under the host device's pull: latency on top of the device's period,
  and how late QEMU's main loop may run before a gap is heard. Raise it
  if gaps are counted, lower it under KVM. The stderr lines to read are
  `qemu-embed: audio:` and `[audio] … underruns` (gaps), `[audio] device
  asks for N frames` (how chunky the device is), and `[audio] the
  guest's mix went past full scale` (voices summed past full scale,
  since QEMU applies no mixer volume there, and how far the limiter
  turned it down). Pacing design: doc 11.
- `QEMU_EMBED_AUDIO_TRACE=1` prints the embed audiodev's pacing, a line
  per call.
- `PLAYER_AUDIO_NULL=<frames>` drains the ring with no device, like a
  DAC taking that many frames a period at 48 kHz (`1` = 1024,
  PipeWire's default).
- `PLAYER_AUDIO_TAP=out.wav` records exactly what the player handed the
  device, padded silence included (`tools/audio-glitch-test.py` counts
  clicks in it).
- `LIBSYNTH_SF2=<file.sf2>` is the General MIDI bank (doc 20). The
  player sets it itself (the packaged bank, or `soundfonts/` in a
  checkout), so this is for trying another; a machine that names its own
  wins. `LIBSYNTH_MT32_ROMS=<dir>` is the same for the CM-32L's ROMs,
  which are the user's own.
- `LIBSYNTH_MIDI_LOG=<file>` / `LIBSYNTH_OPL_LOG=<file>` capture what a
  guest wrote to a music device, for `synthx midilog` / `opllog` /
  `play` (doc 20 §7.2).

### Gamepads

Track: `docs/tracks/m13-gamepads.md`. The launcher writes `--pad` from
the machine's `pad` setting (`launcherx --print-player-args
<machine.toml>` shows it).

- `player --pads` says what this host can read: the one place a build
  without the `gilrs` feature, or a sandbox with no `/dev/input`,
  reports itself.
- `--pad usb` (or `PLAYER_PAD=usb`) drives the machine's `usb-gamepad`
  (patch 26): two sticks, an 8-way hat and twelve buttons, bound by the
  HID driver of XP, 98 SE and Me with nothing installed (98 SE asks for
  its source files the first time). The launcher adds `-usb -device
  usb-gamepad`. Not offered on DOS.
- `--pad gameport` drives the gameport at 0x201 (patch 27) with the same
  pad state: two axes and four buttons, the face buttons as 1–4, the
  d-pad folded onto the first stick's axes. Offered on DOS and Win98; on
  9x the port wants Add New Hardware and a calibration.
- `--pad keys` (or `PLAYER_PAD=keys`) maps the pad onto keys: the d-pad
  and left stick are the arrows, the face buttons Ctrl, Alt, Space and
  Enter, Start is Esc. It works on every guest, but a game asking
  DirectInput for a joystick still finds none.
- `PLAYER_PAD_SCRIPT="30:lx=1.0,45:south=1,51:south=0"` is a synthetic
  pad that wins over real hardware: a control set to a value at a guest
  frame (frames, not milliseconds, so a run lands in the same place
  every time). Controls: `lx`/`ly`/`rx`/`ry` (-1.0..1.0, negative is
  left/up), `south`/`east`/`west`/`north`,
  `dpad_up`/`down`/`left`/`right`, `l1`/`r1`/`l2`/`r2`, `l3`/`r3`,
  `select`/`start` (0 or 1).
- `PLAYER_PAD_LOG=1` prints every shaped reading and its transitions.
- `PLAYER_PAD_SHAPING="0.30,0.55,0.40"` overrides deadzone, press and
  release. Release must be below press: with one threshold a stick held
  at it chatters at the poll rate.
- `player --pad-sweep <frames>` replays `PLAYER_PAD_SCRIPT` with no
  window, QEMU or guest and prints what came out (with `--pad keys`, the
  key presses too). It is the `pad` check.

### QMP

The player always attaches a control monitor over a socketpair (no
socket file). A script adds its own `-qmp unix:…,server,nowait`.

- `PLAYER_QMP=1` logs every QMP event (SHUTDOWN, RESET, STOP… are logged
  regardless).
- `PLAYER_QMP_EXEC='{"execute":"query-status"}'` (or a JSON array) runs
  requests once the guest has drawn its first frame and prints the
  replies.

### Direct3D pass-through (doc 14)

The `d3dpt` device loads the executor (`D3DPT_EXEC_LIB`, else
`build/d3dpt/libd3dpt_exec.so`) and DXVK (`D3DPT_DXVK_LIB`) on the
guest's first use. `D3DPT_EXEC=auto|dxvk|wine|none` picks the back end,
as does the adapter's `exec=` (`-global d3dpt-vga.exec=wine` in the
machine form's extra arguments). `-global d3dpt-vga.no-exec=on` models a
host with no executor. On Windows `D3DPT_D3D9=auto|dxvk|system` picks
the Direct3D 9 underneath ([build-windows.md](build-windows.md)).
`launcherx --host-check` says which back end this host gets.

The executor on Wine (ADR-018) is loaded through `libd3dpt_exec_remote`
inside QEMU, whose knobs are:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `D3DPT_EXEC_REMOTE_LIB` | `build/d3dpt/` or `lib/2ksbox/` |
| `D3DPT_EXEC_HOST` (`d3dpt-exec-host.exe`) | `wine/` beside the library |
| `D3DPT_WINE` | the Mac Wine apps, then `wine64`/`wine` on `PATH`; a path that does not exist means *no Wine* (how a test takes it away) |
| `D3DPT_WINEPREFIX` | `<data dir>/2ksbox/wine` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`, `~/.local/share`, `~/Library/Application Support`) |
| `D3DPT_WINE_RENDERER` | `gl`; `vulkan` is a data point only |
| `D3DPT_REMOTE_DIR` | the directory of the shared VRAM file |

Diagnostics:

- `D3DPT_DUMP_DIR=dir D3DPT_DUMP_EVERY=60` writes every 60th presented
  frame as `dir/frame-NNNNNN.ppm` (bare `qemu-system-i386` too).
- `D3DPT_DP2_TRACE`, `D3DPT_DDI_REREAD`, `D3DPT_DDI_NOFOG` trace the
  display driver's DP2 stream (doc 15; `docs/testing.md`).
- Guest side, `D3DPT_TRACE=1` or a file `d3dpt_trace.on` next to the DLL
  writes the creation / lock / upload / present calls to
  `d3d8_trace.log` / `d3d9_trace.log`. A DLL that cannot open the device
  forwards `Direct3DCreateN` to the system DLL.
- While a 3D device is active, the player shows the VGA surface again
  after 1 s without a presented frame if the guest drew on it (an error
  box, a movie, a crashed game): `[display] no 3D frame for …`.
- `player --companions` prints what `player/src/companions.rs` resolved
  for the Glide wrapper, the executor, DXVK and the Wine pair; it is the
  packagers' check.

### Glide pass-through (doc 12 §5)

The guest's `GLIDE2X.DLL` reaches a host wrapper QEMU dlopens at
`grGlideInit`; qemu-3dfx ships none, so ours is OpenGLide. QEMU finds it
at `QEMU_GLIDE_LIB`, else `build/glide/libglide2x.so`, else on the
loader's path, and logs `glidept: wrapper <path>`. It renders into the
same window-less context as the GL pass-through, so Glide frames go
through the shader chain. `GLIDE_HOST_LOG=<path|->` turns on its log.
Guest side: `GLIDE\` on the ISO (`SETUP.EXE` installs it).

### OpenGL pass-through (doc 12)

The guest's `OPENGL32.DLL` (`OPENGL\` on the ISO, `SETUP /GAME 3`) is
qemu-3dfx's wrapper; it reaches the device through the mapper the Glide
component installs. It reads **`WRAPGL32.EXT` from the game's own
folder**, shipped beside it with `ExtensionsYear,1997`: a modern host's
extension string runs to thousands of characters, and a 1990s title
copies it into a fixed buffer (GLQuake's is 4096 bytes; it returns into
the text of the list). Raise the year for a later game or delete the
file. `SETUP /GAME` never overwrites one.

qemu-3dfx's host-side knobs are in `mesagl.cfg`, read from QEMU's
*current working directory* at start-up, one `Key,value` per line:
`ExtensionsYear`, `ExtensionsLength`, `VertexCacheMB`, `DispTimerMS`,
`BufOAccelEN`, `ContextMSAA`, `ContextSRGB`, `ContextVsyncOff`,
`RenderScalerOff`, `FpsLimit`, `DumpShader`, `CheckError`, `FifoTrace`,
`FuncTrace`. On macOS `DispTimerMS` also picks the GL profile (0, the
default, is core; non-zero is compatibility). If presentation stutters
unless the mouse moves, try `DispTimerMS,16`, `ContextVsyncOff,1` or
`FpsLimit,60` first.

On a Linux host, frames go through the embed backend's dma-buf ring
(doc 12 §4):

- `EMBED_ZC_PROBE=<n>` sets how often a slot is checked for still being
  the memory it was made over (a known colour written through GL, read
  back with `gbm_bo_map`). A slot that fails is freed and made again:
  this is the repair, not a diagnostic. Checks are dense while the ring
  is young, then one present in 512. `=0` turns it off; `EMBED_ZC_HEAL=0`
  leaves a bad slot alone to study.
- `EMBED_ZC_SLOTS=<n>` uses the first n buffers (default all).
- `EMBED_ZC_CHECK=<n>` reads four pixels of the buffer just blitted,
  every n-th present, through GL and from the buffer's memory. Weaker
  than the probe: while the picture does not change, the two agree
  whether or not the buffer is written. `EMBED_ZC_MARK=1` adds a line per
  present, for cutting a `FuncTrace,2` log.
- `PLAYER_ZC_IMPORT=0` accepts every dma-buf and imports none (declining
  one turns the ring off), so the ring runs with no Vulkan behind it.
  The picture is wrong while set; it is for reading `EMBED_ZC_CHECK`
  lines.
- `EMBED_ZC_SETTLE=<ms>` waits that long after offering a buffer before
  using it, since accepting an offer only queues the import. It rules the
  import race out (it is not the cause).
- `tools/zc-vulkan-test.c` drives the ring with the frontend's Vulkan
  import alone (`docs/testing.md`).

## The launcher's front ends

`launcher-core` decides everything and a front end draws and forwards
events (doc 07, ADR-014). `launcher-qt` is the one every package
installs as `2ksbox` (ADR-015); the egui front end was deleted
(ADR-017).

`launcher-qt` is its own cargo workspace, so a root `cargo build` never
needs Qt 6. `build.sh`'s `qt` stage builds it; a host with no Qt 6 skips
that stage and can roll no package. There is no CMake: `cxx-qt-build`
finds Qt through `qmake6`. In a checkout the binary is
`launcher-qt/target/release/launcher-qt`, and it finds the player in the
root `target/release` (`LAUNCHER_PLAYER_BIN` overrides).

The toolkit-free debug verbs (`launcher_core::cli`: `--print-args`,
`--print-player-args`, `--new`, `--discs`, `--host-check`, `--paths`,
`--diagnose`, `--wizard-edit`, …) answer identically from `launcher-qt`
and from `launcherx`, a binary with no toolkit that `scripts/test.sh`
and the guest tools drive:

```sh
cargo build --release -p launcher-core --bin launcherx
target/release/launcherx --print-args ~/.local/share/2ksbox/machines/xp/machine.toml
```

`launcher-qt` grabs its real windows headless itself
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` with `LAUNCHER_QT_SHOT`, doc 07).

**`launcher-capi`** is a C ABI over the same models (opaque handles,
index-addressed rows, caller-owned strings) for a front end in Swift or
anything that speaks C:

```sh
cargo build -p launcher-capi            # liblauncher_capi.{a,so}; not a default member
cc -Ilauncher-capi/include my_frontend.c target/debug/liblauncher_capi.a -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread
```

`launcher-capi/include/launcher_core.h` is the header;
`launcher-capi/examples/smoke.c` is a working miniature front end and
the `capi` check.

## Testing

Integration and end-to-end only, run locally by `scripts/test.sh
host|all`; policy and tools in [testing.md](testing.md). CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is manual-trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
and never runs the suite.

## Packaging

Everything is named **2ksbox** (ADR-011). The install layout every
package shares is doc 07's "The install layout". Every packager opens
the staged launcher's real window offscreen and requires a PNG, because
Qt's platform plugin and QML modules are named in no import table.

### Linux tarball

```sh
scripts/package-linux.sh                  # build/package/2ksbox-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.zst
scripts/package-linux.sh --with-shaders   # + the ~80 MB preset collection
```

It stages the launcher, the player, the embed library, our `qemu-img`,
the firmware, the guest-tools ISO and the libraries QEMU `dlopen`s
(Glide wrapper, executor + DXVK, the Wine pair) into one relocatable
prefix, checks that everything resolves inside it from a scrubbed
environment (`docs/testing.md`), and rolls a tarball. **Qt 6 is not in
it**: it needs the distribution's `qt6-base` and `qt6-declarative`
(Debian/Ubuntu: `libqt6quick6` plus the `qml6-module-qtquick-*`
packages), and `install.sh` names them when the loader cannot find
them. The extracted tree runs in place (`bin/2ksbox`); `install.sh`
copies it into a prefix (`~/.local` by default) with a desktop entry,
`com._2ksbox.Launcher.desktop` (the window's `app_id`). The tarball
ships no system libraries, so it wants a host much like the one that
built it; the Flatpak is the portable answer.

### Flatpak

```sh
scripts/package-flatpak.sh          # build, install --user, smoke check
flatpak run com._2ksbox.Launcher
```

Built from source against `org.kde.Sdk` 6.10 (Qt from KDE's runtime,
`org.freedesktop.Platform` 25.08 underneath). Set `FLATPAK_BUILD_DIR`
(and flatpak's own `FLATPAK_USER_DIR`) to keep the ~12 GB build tree off
the root filesystem. The build is offline, as Flathub requires: every
crate is declared with a checksum in `packaging/flatpak/cargo-sources.json`.
Run `scripts/gen-flatpak-cargo-sources.sh` and commit the result
whenever a dependency changes.

### macOS (`2ksbox.app` / `.dmg`)

`scripts/package-macos.sh` on Apple Silicon bundles the whole non-system
dylib closure, Qt through `macdeployqt`, the Glide wrapper, and the
executor with the LunarG loader and KosmicKrisp, then signs with the
hardened runtime and the JIT entitlement, notarizes and staples.
`--community` is ADR-019's community build, which adds the Wine pair.
Details: [build-macos.md](build-macos.md), "The app".

### Windows (`.zip`)

Cross-built from Linux in a Fedora mingw-w64 container
(`scripts/win-cross.sh --build`, `scripts/build-windows.sh`,
`scripts/package-windows.sh`): `2ksbox.exe` (the Qt launcher),
`2ksbox-player.exe`, `libqemu-embed-i386.dll`, the executor with DXVK,
`qemu-img.exe`, firmware and guest tools in one portable folder.
Details: [build-windows.md](build-windows.md).

## Diagnostics and logs

- `launcher --paths` prints where this build looks for each companion;
  ask for it first when something says a file is missing. `launcher
  --diagnose` adds this host's 3D and files it in `launcher.log` (beside
  the machine library), which is what to send when the launcher did not
  come up. On Windows, where the launcher has no stdout,
  `2ksbox-debug.bat` in the package does that.
- Every Play writes the full player command line to `launcher.log` as
  `[player] …`, quoted for pasting back into a shell.
- The Qt front end follows the desktop's light or dark mode. On Windows
  it uses Qt's Windows 11 style, FluentWinUI3
  (`QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Windows` is the older look); elsewhere Fusion
  or the macOS style. Never force a palette: a Quick Controls style draws
  its controls in the *platform theme's* palette, and a palette handed to
  the application reaches only the surfaces around them, which made a
  mixed look. `LAUNCHER_QT_SCHEME=light|dark` forces a scheme for a
  comparison; `launcher.log` records the style and colours a run got.
- On Linux the launcher asks for the **XDG desktop portal platform
  theme** (`QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=xdgdesktopportal`, set in `main.rs` when
  the variable is empty). Qt picks a theme by `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, and
  a session it matches nothing to (sway, a plain window manager) gets
  one with no file dialog and no colour scheme: Qt's own picker and a
  light window on a dark desktop. The portal theme wraps the theme Qt
  would have picked and defers to it when the bus has no file chooser,
  so KDE and GNOME lose nothing. Set the variable yourself to compare
  (`gtk3`, `kde`, or empty for Qt's choice).

## Licensing, for packagers

Everything that links QEMU in-process is GPL-2.0: the `player`,
`qemu-embed`, and `libdisc` and `libsynth`, which are compiled into QEMU.

The **launcher** (`launcher-core`, `launcher-qt`, `launcher-capi`) and
the `shader-chain` crate it shares with the player are
**GPL-2.0-or-later** (ADR-009). None links QEMU (the launcher spawns the
player as a separate process), and they link Apache-2.0 crates (`ring`
under `ureq`'s rustls, among others) that GPLv2 cannot take and GPLv3
can. `launcher-qt` links Qt 6 under the LGPLv3 for the same reason.

Original code is Rust wherever possible (ADR-004); C appears only inside
QEMU / qemu-3dfx and in guest-side era code. The GPLv2 text is in
`COPYING`, every third-party component in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

**If you package or redistribute the player, read this.** Its
dependency tree contains **Apache-2.0-only** crates (`winit`, `cpal`,
`ab_glyph`, `codespan-reporting`, `rspirv` among them), and Apache-2.0
is incompatible with GPLv2, which the player is pinned to because it
links QEMU. `winit` alone settles it; being clean would mean dropping
wgpu and librashader, the CRT shader chain the project exists for. **We
ship player binaries anyway**, with complete source and build scripts;
the reasoning and the rejected alternatives are ADR-010. If your
distribution's policy cannot accept that, please open an issue rather
than patching around it. The clean fix (QEMU in its own process) is
designed and costed.
