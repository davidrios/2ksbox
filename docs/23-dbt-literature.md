# 23. The parked optimizations against the literature

What the dynamic-binary-translation literature has on the TCG work this
project parked or could not do, searched arXiv first. The last section
builds each ranked candidate as a spike and measures it on doc 22's
tier. The queue itself is in `patches/qemu/README.md`, docs 13, 16 and
18 and the M8/M9 track docs. The next session on TCG performance starts
here rather than searching again. Doc 22 §7 is the short form.

None of this was read before the patches were written: the queue was
built from profiles of the workloads by Claude, the AI assistant that did
the implementation work, and the survey came afterwards. Where a patch
matches a paper below, the two arrived at the same place independently.

**Coverage note.** arXiv carries almost nothing on dynamic binary
translation: a full-text search for "dynamic binary translation" returns
nine papers, of which three touch our problems. The field publishes at
VEE, CGO, TACO, ASPLOS, PLDI, DATE and ISP RAS, so most entries below are
venue papers. The arXiv-native ones are marked.

## What we parked, and who has worked on it

### 1. The softmmu TLB chain

Our profile puts the four-load TLB lookup at ~43 % of generated-code
samples on integer code (7-Zip). The M9 track designed and probed the
structural fix: run TCG's output inside a Hypervisor.framework VM at EL1
with the guest's x86 page tables mirrored into stage 1, so a guest load
is a host load. It measured every primitive on the Air (1.4–2.6x per
load; helpers must run inside the VM; the one risk is the nested-TLB
penalty on working sets beyond ~12 MiB) and parked it at "4–8 weeks".
The literature has built that design four times:

- **Captive.** Spink, Wagstaff, Franke, *Hardware-Accelerated
  Cross-Architecture Full-System Virtualization*, [TACO 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2996798);
  the retargetable version *A Retargetable System-Level DBT Hypervisor*,
  [USENIX ATC 2019](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc19-spink.pdf).
  The DBT runs in ring 0 inside a KVM VM, the guest MMU is mapped onto
  nested paging, device I/O and interrupts cross the VM boundary. ARM
  guest on x86 host: 2.5x average, 5.88x peak over QEMU on SPEC CPU2006.
  The closest published relative of our probe's verdict, including the
  device/interrupt half our probe left as a mailbox protocol.
- **Rodzevich, Batuzov, Koltunov, Cheremnov, Shlyapin**, *Efficient MMU
  Emulation in Case of Cross-ISA Dynamic Binary Translation*,
  [ISPRAS 2024](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10899135/): an
  AMD64 guest on an AArch64 host with shadow page tables built for the
  Arm MMU. Our exact ISA pairing, the only paper with it.
- **Poletaev, Dovgalyuk, Teys, Kostin**, *Hardware acceleration of Qemu
  MMU for aarch64 on x86-64 full system emulation*,
  [Proc. ISP RAS 37:6 (2025)](https://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=tisp&paperid=1089&option_lang=eng):
  inside QEMU, an extra mmap view of the guest virtual address space so
  translated loads use a fixed offset instead of the TLB lookup; the
  abstract's speedup figure is truncated at "271" (read: up to ~2.7x).
- **ESPT.** Chang, Wu et al., *Efficient Memory Virtualization for
  Cross-ISA System Mode Emulation*, [VEE 2014](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2576195.2576201)
  (a kernel module). **HSPT.** Wang et al., *Practical Implementation
  and Efficient Management of Embedded Shadow Page Tables for Cross-ISA
  System Virtual Machines*, [VEE 2015](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/HSPT:-Practical-Implementation-and-Efficient-of-for-Wang-Li/fa8e9614381ed39e6b978c691aa81e5365984a20)
  (mmap only, 1.98x average on QEMU, ARM on x86-64).

Their numbers agree with our probe's per-load gain, which is the
strongest confirmation the design gets. The user-space mmap variants are
closed to us on the Air: macOS maps at 16 KiB and the guest's pages are
4 KiB; only the VM has the 4 KiB granule (the probe measured `TGran4=0`).
But the per-load gain does not become a workload gain here. A memory
census of each workload times the probe's workload-shaped kernels
projects 1.1–1.2x (7-Zip 1.2x, Super PI and Quake II 1.16x, Blood 1.1x,
the FP kernels 1.05x), and the nested-TLB risk does not occur on any of
them (doc 22 §8.2; the M9 track's "Gauging the gain"). **Abandoned for
now** (user decision): not worth the port's complexity. Read Captive and
the 2024 ISPRAS paper before reopening it.

Cheaper cuts at the same cost that we did take: patch 16 (TLB floor) and
patch 44 (retire instead of flush). Also relevant: Tong, Koju, Kawahito,
Moshovos, *Optimizing Memory Translation Emulation in Full System
Emulators*, [TACO 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2686034): SoftTLB
resizing, a victim TLB (which QEMU adopted), helper threads to flush.

### 2. Indirect branches past patch 20

Patch 20 inlines QEMU's jump-cache probe; what remains is a hash, a
compare and conflict misses (11.7 M hash-table lookups per 10 s in
3DMark 99 with the stock 4096 entries, 2.5 M after patch 42 grew the
cache to 65,536).

- **Tiaozhuan.** Li, Guo, Lan, Xue, Han, Niu, Zhang, *A General and
  Efficient Indirect Branch Optimization for Binary Translation*,
  [TACO 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3703355): a table indexed
  directly by guest PC in a large reserved address space ("full address
  mapping"), so a lookup is 1–2 host instructions, plus
  "exception-assisted branch elimination" for the correctness check.
  In LATX (x86 guest on LoongArch): +3.9 % average, +19.4 % peak on SPEC
  CPU2006. For a 32-bit guest the table is 32 GiB of lazily populated
  virtual address space.
- **MAMBO-X64.** D'Antras, Gorgovan, Garside, Luján, *Low Overhead
  Dynamic Binary Translation on ARM*, [PLDI 2017](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/low-overhead-dynamic-binary-translation-on-arm/),
  and *Optimizing Indirect Branches in Dynamic Binary Translators*,
  [TACO 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2866573): translated
  call/ret pairs that push host addresses so the hardware return-address
  predictor works; `ret` is most of our indirect branches.
- **SPIRE.** Jia et al., *SPC-Indexed Indirect Branch Redirecting*,
  [VEE 2013](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2517326.2451516): trampolines
  in the source code space.

Generic, exact, and on top of patch 20: the cheapest candidate here.

### 3. Pinned guest registers (patch 21, parked)

- **Zurstraßen, Bosbach, Reimann, Leupers**, *Static Global Register
  Allocation for Dynamic Binary Translators*,
  [DATE 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993060/): static
  guest-to-host register mappings, up to 1.4x over block-local allocation
  (RISC-V on ARM64). Doc 18's idea; confirms the size of the prize
  (ours: 7-Zip decompress +16 %).
- **Batuzov**, *Global register allocation during dynamic binary
  translation*, [Proc. ISP RAS](https://ispranproceedings.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/178?locale=en_US):
  per-block pre/post conditions in QEMU, 29.6 % on a synthetic example.
- *Low-Compilation-Cost Register Allocation in LLVM-Based Binary
  Translation*, [EuroSys 2026](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3767295.3803591).

### 4. Cheap IEEE flag checks (the deferred `fp-relaxed` mode)

- **Cota**, hardfloat, [QEMU 2018](https://patchew.org/QEMU/20181124235553.17371-1-cota@braap.org/):
  use the host FPU when the inexact flag is already sticky. Patches 06
  and 11 apply and extend that rule.
- **Zurstraßen, Bosbach, Jünger, Leupers**, *Rapid RISC-V Floating Point
  Vector Simulation*, [RAPIDO 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721848.3721853):
  the same corner cases as patch 11's per-op checks; add and sub cannot
  underflow, so that check is dead; the checks vectorised. May trim doc
  16's "~25 instructions per packed check" without giving up exactness.

### 5. x87 at 64-bit precision, exact

Patches 48/49 keep the x80 as the shadow and do `*` and `fst m32`
inline; add, sub and div are still 128-bit integer helpers.

- **Zhang, Aiken**, *High-Performance Branch-Free Algorithms for
  Extended-Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic*,
  [SC '25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3712285.3759876): branch-free
  double-word add, sub, mul, div and sqrt on floating-point expansions,
  with machine-verified error bounds, 11.7x over QD. An x80 mantissa
  fits a pair of doubles exactly, so this is a possible FPU-side route
  for the remaining helpers; the final rounding to 64 bits still needs
  its own argument. Speculative.

### 6. Self-modifying code residue

Patch 24 refuses stores on the second page of a page-straddling block,
and the M9 track's open items want two-page blocks linkable.

- **Dehnert et al.**, *The Transmeta Code Morphing Software*,
  [CGO 2003](http://www.xsim.com/papers/transmeta-code-morphong-software.dehnert-cgo03.pdf):
  self-checking translations that verify their own source bytes on entry
  instead of being invalidated on write, plus fine-grain write protection
  of code/data mixed pages. Old, but the exact technique.

### 7. Interrupt checks per block

- **Niu, Zhang, Li**, *Eliminate the overhead of interrupt checking in
  full-system dynamic binary translator*, [SYSTOR 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534056.3534939).
  Patch 43 took the larger part of that cost (the block ends that forced
  the main loop).

### 8. Memory barriers on the Arm host

- **Risotto.** Gouicem et al., *A Dynamic Binary Translator for Weak
  Memory Model Architectures*, [ASPLOS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3567955.3567962):
  verified fence placement for x86 on Arm, +6.7 %. On the M1 doc 16's
  memory-operand bench saw no cost from the barriers and 7-Zip 2–10 %
  (single runs); `-smp 1,maxcpus=1` already drops them, and a default
  would need an audit (M9 track, "Open").

## The arXiv-native papers

- [2402.09688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09688), *A System-Level
  Dynamic Binary Translator using Automatically-Learned Translation
  Rules* (2024): learned rules inside system-mode QEMU, 1.36x over QEMU
  6.1 on SPEC CINT2006. The only arXiv paper about speeding up
  full-system QEMU. Rules learned from a modern compiler's patterns may
  not fit MSVC-6-era code.

Nothing, on arXiv or elsewhere, addresses the Voodoo 2's per-dword MMIO
trap; doc 21 §9's RAM-backed FIFO window is our answer to it.

## Ranking, by fit and evidence

1. The hardware-MMU papers (they de-risk the parked design and share our
   ISA pairing).
2. Tiaozhuan plus the return-address trick (cheap, exact, on top of
   patch 20).
3. The DATE 2025 register paper as a cross-check for patch 21's open
   items.
4. The RAPIDO 2025 flag-check paper for doc 16's follow-ups.
5. SC '25 double-word arithmetic for x87 PC=64 (speculative).

## Spikes: each candidate tried, one at a time

Each ranked item was implemented as a spike (user request) and measured on doc 22's reproducible tier (`tools/specbench/run.sh`,
the XP image, every launch through `noaslr`): one build of the tree with
every spike behind its own `-accel tcg` switch, a fresh `default` run of
the unchanged binary the same morning as the control, and the guest
stage of `scripts/test.sh` on every build (the DOS x87 / rep / SMC / SSE
batteries, the PIT clock, MIDI, ATAPI, the pad; the Voodoo checks were
out of scope). Super PI's digits are identical in every row. The diff,
the scripts that produce it and every run's result lines are under
`docs/22-data/spikes/`; nothing from it is in the patch queue. Run-to-run noise on this tier is about
±2 % (doc 22 §5.2), and the control itself came out 1–2 % under doc 22's
row, so a difference under 3 % is nothing.

| spike | switch | Super PI 1M (s) | 7-Zip (MIPS) | SSEBENCH (ns) | nbench | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| control, the tree as committed | — | 75.2 | 1553 | 2.37 | 1.00 | doc 22's `default`, remeasured |
| **A** Tiaozhuan's full address mapping: the jump cache as a table indexed by the pc itself | `jump-table` | 73.5 | 1588 | 2.30 | 1.01 | ≤ 2 %, within noise |
| **B** SYSTOR 2022, the exit-request check at back edges and indirect branches only | `irq-check-backedge` | 74.3 | 1583 | 2.29 | 1.01 | ≤ 2 %, within noise |
| A + B | both | 73.9 | 1583 | 2.30 | 1.01 | as above |
| **D** MAMBO-X64's return prediction: a return-address ring, `call` through a host `bl`, `ret` through a host `ret` | `ras`, on top of A + B | 75.5 | 1574 | 2.45 | 1.01 | a loss: −2 % Super PI, −6 % SSEBENCH |
| **C** RAPIDO 2025, the ceiling: every SSE result check removed (inexact, `SSES_NOCHECK=1`) | — | — | — | 2.17 | — | the checks cost ≤ 6 % of the SSE score (convert 16 %, scalar chain 8 %, packed ops 0–1 %); nothing exact can take more |
| **E** DATE 2025 / patch 21, pinned registers, capped at seven (`QEMU_TCG_PIN_MAX=7`) | `pinned-regs` | XP rebooted during Super PI | | | | the crash is not the eighth register: it reproduces at seven (`pinned-7/reboot.png`) |

What each one is, and what the number says:

- **A, the pc-indexed jump table** (§2, Tiaozhuan). 32 GiB of address
  space reserved with `MAP_NORESERVE`, an entry per 32-bit pc holding the
  TB pointer in its low 48 bits and patch 42's generation above them
  (16 bits; the wrap re-maps the table), materialised a host page at a
  time; a single-page TLB flush re-maps the page's 32 KiB rather than
  writing it so an `invlpg` of a data page does not touch it; a TB flush
  re-maps the whole thing. The inline probe's address chain to the entry
  goes from eight dependent operations (the hash) to three, and there
  are no conflict misses. Exact (the same cs_base / flags / cflags /
  generation compare as before). The tier does not see it: 7-Zip's
  indirect-branch working set already fit the 65,536-entry cache after
  patch 42, and the hash was not on the critical path of a chain that
  ends in five dependent loads anyway. Its case, if it has one, is a
  Windows 98 game with thousands of virtual-call targets, which §6 of
  doc 22 would have to measure; not done here.
- **B, the check at back edges** (§7). A TB not under icount and not in
  an interrupt shadow skips the `icount_decr` test at its start; the
  target emits it before every backward direct jump and every indirect
  branch (every cycle in the block graph contains one). It also emits it
  before the jump that ends a TB an I/O instruction ended (the PIT check
  found this by failing on the first build), because patch 34 delivers
  the PIT's overdue edge on the `in` itself and counts on the next block
  start to take it. Exact, and the interrupt latency in straight-line code goes
  from "next block" to "next back edge or return". Two host
  instructions per block, an L1 load that was never on the critical path
  of an out-of-order core: nothing to measure. The paper's gains were on
  an in-order LoongArch.
- **D, return prediction** (§2, MAMBO-X64). Two TCG ops: `call_tb`
  (a goto_tb reached through `bl` to a three-instruction stub in the
  caller's TB, which stores the host return address into a ring entry
  beside the guest return address and the calling TB) and `goto_ret`
  (a goto_ptr emitted as `ret`), a 64-entry ring in the jump cache, the
  `call` side in `gen_jmp_rel` (32-bit code, same-page continuation,
  never for `call $+5`), the `ret` side before the ordinary probe: pop,
  compare the popped address with the target, compare the calling TB's
  cs_base / flags / cflags with the current ones (the landing is a
  `goto_tb` to the continuation and must be the exact one), `ret` on a
  hit, fall through to the probe on a miss. Exact; every battery passes.
  And slower: the ring push at every call (eight instructions and two
  stores) plus the branch at every `ret` cost more than the host `ret`'s
  prediction saves, which says the M1's indirect predictor was already
  getting most of the `br` targets right. Unmeasured: the ring's hit
  rate, which a counter would give and which decides whether a second
  iteration (the ring in the CPU's negative-offset state, no push for
  leaf calls) is worth having. Parked with that note.
- **C, cheaper IEEE checks** (§4). The paper's own point, that an add or
  sub cannot underflow so that check is dead, was already true of patch 11:
  add and sub check only "exponent field not all ones", two operations.
  The experiment removes every check (inexact, an experiment knob only)
  and bounds what any trimming could buy: 6 % of the SSE score, all of it
  in the scalar and convert kernels, none in the packed ones the games
  run. Closed.
- **E, pinned registers** (§3). The DATE 2025 paper confirms the prize
  patch 21 measured (+16 % on 7-Zip decompress); the open item was the
  crash, believed to be an eighth pinned register. It is not: with the
  count capped at seven the XP guest rebooted in Super PI's first
  repetition exactly as doc 22's nine-register run did. The bug is in the
  pinned path itself; the next step is to catch the reboot (`-d int`)
  and bisect over the allocator changes, not a different count.
- **Not spiked.** §1, the hardware MMU: weeks, by the probe's own
  estimate, and its user-space variants are closed on macOS (16 KiB
  pages). §5, SC '25 double-word arithmetic for x87 at 64 bits: its
  ceiling is already measured (`x87-pc64-as-53` is the same kernels with
  the 64-bit rounding removed, LU 3.0x → 5.3x and neural net 2.7x → 4.9x,
  doc 22 §5.3), but the final rounding of a 106-bit double-double to a
  64-bit mantissa has the double-rounding problem on halfway cases and
  the argument that makes it exact is the whole work; not a spike. §6,
  Transmeta's self-checking translations: only a Windows 98 renderer
  exercises it, and the games tier is a day of runs. §8: already
  measured, and a change of default rather than a technique.

**The conclusion.** On this tier the queue is at the point where the
literature's remaining generic ideas buy nothing measurable: the
control-flow patches already took the part of each that mattered on an
out-of-order host, and the remaining large lever, the softmmu TLB chain
(§1), is the one that costs weeks. The two numbers that would change this
are the games (a Windows 98 title's virtual-call working set for A) and
the ring's hit rate (for D); both are cheap to take next.
