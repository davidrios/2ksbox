# Wine's Direct3D tests: our patch queue

`guest-tools/build-winetests.sh` fetches Wine's `dlls/d3d8/tests/`,
`dlls/d3d9/tests/` and `include/wine/` at a pinned tag (a sparse
checkout in `build/winetest/<tag>/`, not vendored: the tests are LGPL)
and applies these in filename order onto restored sources before every
build. None changes what a test checks. 01 to 03 are behind a macro the
script defines; **04 and 05 add or remove no line** (the baselines in
`reference/winetest/` are keyed by source line, so a patch that moves
lines makes every later key read as new). Track M16
(`docs/tracks/m16-dx9-ddi.md`).

Beside the queue, the script force-includes
`guest-tools/src/winetest/w98compat.h` into every test file: Win98's
user32 exports the Unicode display calls the tests use
(`EnumDisplaySettingsW`, `ChangeDisplaySettingsExW`, `GetMonitorInfoW`,
...) as stubs failing with `ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, and each
wrapper falls back to the ANSI call only on that error, so XP's results
do not move. It also defines 04's trace macro.

| Patch | What | Why | Drop when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-d3d9-device-no-d3d9on12` | `WINETEST_NO_D3D9ON12` fences `test_d3d9on12` and its includes in d3d9 `device.c` | it needs `d3d9on12.h` and `dxgi1_4.h`, which mingw lacks; D3D9On12 is Windows 10, so the test skips on XP and 98 anyway | never |
| `02-d3d8-visual-no-wow64` | `WINETEST_NO_WOW64` fences the WoW64 probe in d3d8 `visual.c`'s `START_TEST` | it reads `TEB64` / `PEB64` and a `TEB` field mingw's headers do not have; a 32-bit XP or 98 guest is never WoW64 | never |
| `04-trace-create-device` | the tests' `create_device` (d3d8 `device.c` and `visual.c`, d3d9 `device.c`) traces a failed `CreateDevice`: hr, adapter, size, format, windowed, depth format, flags (`WINETEST_TRACE_CREATE_DEVICE` in `w98compat.h`) | the rig's Win98 made no d3d8 device at all, and the tests only say they skipped | when Win98's device creation is understood |
| `05-d3d9-visual-yuv-no-surface` | d3d9 `visual.c`'s `yuv_color_test` goes on to the next format when `CreateOffscreenPlainSurface` fails (the check still fails) | on the rig's Win98 the surface failed and the test locked the NULL pointer, ending the file at `visual.c:12859` | never |
| `03-d3d9-visual-null-device-skip` | `WINETEST_NULL_DEVICE_SKIP` returns from d3d9 `visual.c`'s `test_desktop_window` when the device with a NULL window was not made | XP's runtime refuses a windowed device with neither a focus nor a device window (the documented rule), and the test then calls through the NULL device and ends the file with 17 tests unrun | never |

Regenerate a patch as in `patches/qemu/README.md`: `git diff --no-index
--no-prefix` between a pristine copy and the edited one, then apply it
to a pristine checkout (`git -C build/winetest/<tag> checkout -- .`)
before committing.
