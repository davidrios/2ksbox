"""The Voodoo 2 device as a *guest* meets it (doc 21, M14), with no 3dfx
driver in the picture: a DOS program finds the card in PCI configuration
space, maps its 16 MiB BAR, checks the Voodoo 2 strap in initEnable, runs
the siProcess measurement 3dfx's Glide starts with (a PCI-clock countdown
that has to read zero, or glide2x.dll polls it for ever -- 2026-09-12), runs
the init sequence 3dfx's own sst1init runs (frame-buffer geometry, video
timing, the DAC's PLL, the colour lookup table, VGA pass-through), fills
the back buffer with red through the linear frame buffer, reads a pixel
of it back through the same window (which makes the chip flush its FIFO:
a store that never landed reads back as something else), swaps, then
drives the **command FIFO** the way 3dfx's Glide does -- packets written
into the ring's window and the chip told nothing -- in two batches (a blue
fastfill and swap that has to follow a JMP from the ring's end back to its
start, then a magenta one after the read pointer was read), and gives the
monitor back to the VGA.

The FIFO half is what guards `ramfifo` (doc 21 §9): with it on (the
default) the window is RAM and the device finds the packets itself at the
guest's next access to the card, poisoning what the chip consumed before it
answers the read pointer. `RAMFIFO=off` runs the same program on the
per-dword MMIO path, the A/B (the `voodoo-guest-mmiofifo` check).

The last phase is the **dither subtraction** (doc 21 §9): a grey that
dithers in every channel over the whole screen, then blended onto itself
96 times per column at falling alpha, through the chip's own triangle
setup. A colour blended onto itself is that colour, so every column's
pixel must read the reference band's and the screendump must be one 4x4
dither tile from corner to corner -- which it is only if each blend's
read-back had its dither taken out. 86Box's interpreter always did;
its two code generators did not until patch 64 (the columns walked
7bef ... 6b4d, 10,240 pixels off the tile). `RECOMP=off` runs the
interpreter, the A/B; `DITHER_SUB=off` (the device's `dither-sub=off`)
is the control that must fail this phase on either path.

Then two phases about **order** (doc 21 §13). The chip has one way in from
the PCI bus, so an LFB write is drawn after every packet the guest put in
the ring before it and a register that reconfigures the FIFO lands behind
them all; 86Box has two queues and empties the LFB one first. *Teardown* is
the guard: a cyan fill and a swap go into the ring and fbiInit7's
command-FIFO bit is cleared at once, with no idle wait -- the frame has to
be cyan (the packets were run, not dropped) and the status register has to
read idle afterwards, which is what Glide's grSstIdle waits for at
grSstWinClose and what Carmageddon's 3dfx build hung on for ever
(2026-09-18). Both halves of it fail without the fix.

*Ordering* is the scene the `lfb-order` switch is for, not a guard: the ring
gets a red fastfill over the whole screen, then with nothing waited for the
guest writes a blue block through the LFB, then the ring gets the swap. The
block has to be on top. It is on top with the switch either way on an
unloaded host -- the consumer is scheduled before the second of the 38,400
writes is queued -- which is the measurement that says this inversion is not
what makes a game's HUD flash. `LFB_ORDER=on` puts the drain in.

Both phases write swapbufferCMD to the register window as well as putting
the packet in the ring, because 3dfx's Glide does and the card's own
accounting needs it: only Banshee and later count a swap *packet* as
written, while every card's swap decrements `cmd_read`, so the packet
alone drives `written - cmd_read` negative and the status register reads
busy for ever off that difference.

The evidence is on the host side: a QMP screendump while the Voodoo has
the monitor must be the 640x480 red frame (the whole path from a guest
`mov` to the console surface -- register decode, the memory FIFO, the
swap on the display timer's retrace, the CLUT, the pass-through switch),
and one after it lets go must be the VGA's text screen again. Every
`voodoo2:` line QEMU printed is shown.

    tools/voodoo-guest-test.py          # needs nasm, mtools, build/qemu
    VGA=d3dpt tools/voodoo-guest-test.py   # beside our own adapter (std, cirrus, d3dpt)

The 2D adapter is whatever the machine has -- a Voodoo 2 is a 3D-only
card that borrows the monitor -- and `VGA=` picks it: `std` (default),
`cirrus`, or `d3dpt` for `-vga none -device d3dpt-vga`, the pairing a
launcher machine on our own display driver would run. Beside `d3dpt` the
program first puts that adapter in a linear mode, 800x600x32 filled
green, the state a Windows desktop leaves it in: the monitor the Voodoo
hands back is then a linear frame and not the VGA core's text screen, and
the screendump after the hand-back must be that green frame. It used to
stay the Voodoo's last one for good -- the adapter's invalidate did not
put its own surface back on the console when its mode had not changed
(2026-09-12: every full-screen switch on a Win98 machine with the card
left a stale frame up for good).

Outputs in build/voodoo-guest/ (build/voodoo-guest-<VGA>/ beside another
adapter). The `voodoo-guest` and `voodoo-guest-d3dpt` checks in the guest
stage of scripts/test.sh.

; --------------------------------------------------- the dither phase
;
; What repeated alpha blending does to a 16-bit frame buffer, drawn by the
; chip's own triangle rasterizer (doc 21 §9). A Voodoo dithers what it
; writes, so a pixel read back to be blended with carries this position's
; dither offset, and the chip subtracts it again on the way in when
; fbzMode's DITHER_SUB bit is set. 86Box's plain interpreter does that;
; its two recompilers did not until patch 64, so the error accumulated
; there, one blend at a time. The scene makes that visible: a grey that has to dither
; in every channel (130,130,130 -- red and blue step by 8, green by 4),
; drawn over the screen, then blended *onto itself* at alpha 128 in eight
; columns, 1, 2, 4 ... 128 times. Blending a colour onto itself is that
; colour, so every column should stay the background's grey and the bands
; above and below are the reference. One pixel per column goes to COM1.
;
; Everything is packets: with the FIFO on, a direct register write is
; ignored, and the vertices go through the setup unit (sBeginTriCMD /
; sDrawTriCMD), which sorts them and works out the area's sign itself.

; (Carmageddon's 3dfx build hung on quit for exactly that, 2026-09-18).
; The phase writes a cyan fill and a swap, turns the FIFO off with nothing
