"""Does the display see what the guest wrote to video memory?

A DOS program sets a VGA mode and fills video memory **one 4 KiB page at
a time, each page with its own pixel value**, so a screendump answers the
question page by page: which of them reached the display and which are
still showing something else.  Nothing here is a game, a driver or the
player -- it is `qemu-system-i386`, a floppy, and QMP -- so a failure is
QEMU's and a pass sends the question elsewhere.

Why this shape.  A guest reaches video memory two ways, and only one of
them is what a game uses:

  * through the VGA **MMIO ops** (`vga_mem_write`), which mark the region
    dirty themselves.  Planar and odd/even modes go here.
  * as **plain RAM** -- the Cirrus maps its 0xA0000 window as a RAM alias
    whenever the mode allows (`map_linear_vram`), and every VESA linear
    frame buffer is RAM -- where the *only* thing that marks it dirty is
    the softmmu's `TLB_NOTDIRTY` -> `notdirty_write` path.

Reported 2026-09-09: Duke Nukem 3D is clean at 320x200 on `-vga std` and
wrong at 320x200 on `-vga cirrus`, and wrong in its VESA modes on both.
That is exactly the split above -- the one working case is the one that
never touches `notdirty_write` -- so this asks the question with no game
in the way.

Two fills, and the gap between them is half the point:

  * fill 1 writes page p with value p, then the program waits ~2 s, which
    is many refreshes: QEMU snapshots the VGA dirty bitmap and clears it,
    and `tlb_reset_dirty_range_all` is supposed to put `TLB_NOTDIRTY`
    back on every TLB entry for that memory.
  * fill 2 writes page p with value p+32.  **If fill 2 is invisible and
    fill 1 is not, the tracking works once and then stops** -- which is
    what "only the first 15 % of the screen updates" looks like from the
    inside.

And each fill writes even-numbered pages with `rep stosw` and odd ones
with a byte loop, so one screendump also says whether patch 17's REP fast
path is the difference: that would come out striped, every other page.

The palette is programmed by the guest to a grey ramp (entry i -> level
2i) so a screendump's RGB reads back as the pixel value with no table to
trust.  It is set *before* the fills and never touched again, because a
palette write forces a full redraw and would hide the very thing this
looks for.

    tools/vga-dirty-guest-test.py                 # std and cirrus
    tools/vga-dirty-guest-test.py cirrus          # one adapter
    QEMU_EXTRA='-accel tcg,...' tools/vga-dirty-guest-test.py

`VBEPAL=1` sets the palette through the VGA BIOS (VBE 4F09h) instead of
the DAC ports, as DOS Quake and Build do in a VESA mode, and also checks
one entry's channel order through the ports and a 4F09h get.
`VBEPAL=1 ... vesa` is the `vbe-palette` check in scripts/test.sh (the
VGA BIOS of patches/seabios); the rest is local only.

Needs nasm, mtools and build/qemu (it reuses the FreeDOS floppy
`tools/x87-guest-test.py` fetches).  Outputs in build/vga-dirty/.
