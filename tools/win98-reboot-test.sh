# win98-reboot-test.sh — a Win98 guest must survive a restart.

#   tools/win98-reboot-test.sh ~/vms/win98.qcow2 [qmp|guest|both]
#
# The bug this guards (patch 22, docs/tracks/win98-reboot.md): Win98 turns
# its local APIC off through IA32_APIC_BASE, which in QEMU also clears
# CPUID.01H:EDX.APIC; RESET puts the enable bit back but not the feature
# bit, so the next POST is told the CPU has no local APIC, SeaBIOS skips
# smp_setup() and never programs LINT0 as ExtINT -- and the enabled APIC
# with a masked LINT0 swallows every i8259 interrupt. The guest then boots
# to its first wait on the BIOS tick counter at 0040:006C and spins there
# for ever: a frozen splash screen (or a boot menu whose countdown never
# moves) with a cursor that still blinks, because that blink is drawn by
# the VGA adapter on the host side and needs no guest at all.
#
# So the verdict is not "does the screen change". It is:
#
#   1. the machine really reset            -- a second SeaBIOS banner on the
#                                             debugcon, not a screendump
#   2. the guest made progress after it    -- disk reads, which a guest
#                                             spinning on the tick counter
#                                             does not issue (the frozen run
#                                             stops dead at ~400 of them)
#   3. LINT0 is ExtINT again               -- the mechanism itself, so a
#                                             regression is named, not just
#                                             observed
#
# Two ways in, because they are different code paths in QEMU and only the
# second is what a user does: `qmp` is a QMP system_reset, `guest` is the
# Start menu's Shut Down -> Restart typed over QMP. `guest` reports SKIP
# rather than FAIL when the menu could not be driven (no second banner):
# that is the script failing to click, not the machine failing to reboot.
#
# Win98 runs emulated by decision (CLAUDE.md: under KVM this image's
# Explorer dies at startup). The image is never written -- everything goes
# to a qcow2 overlay under build/win98-reboot. Needs a guest image, so it is
# run by hand and never from scripts/test.sh.
#
# Env: OUT=dir, QEMU=binary (an A/B against another build), BIOS=0 (use the
# binary's own firmware instead of qemu/pc-bios, for a stock-QEMU control),
# The first boot is not slept out: this test already counts the guest's
# disk reads, so it waits for them to stop instead (tools/guestwait.sh)
# and BOOT_WAIT is the cap on that.
# BOOT_WAIT=s (the cap, default 300), WATCH=s (default 150), MIN_READS=n (default
# 5000: a full Win98 boot is ~60000, a frozen one ~400).
