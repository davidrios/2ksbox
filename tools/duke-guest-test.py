"""Duke Nukem 3D's music through the machine's own devices (doc 20, M12).

The `midi-guest` battery proves a DOS program can drive an OPL3 and an
MPU-401 that a test wrote by hand. This proves the thing that matters:
that a **real game of the era**, through its own sound system, finds them
and plays its score on them. Duke Nukem 3D is a good one to ask — the
Apogee Sound System it uses supports all three of this milestone's paths
(the Sound Blaster's FM, General MIDI on an MPU-401, and the Gravis's own
wavetable), and its title screen starts the music with nothing to click.

The disc is the user's own and is only ever **read**: the Atomic Edition
CD carries the whole DOS build uncompressed in `ATOMINST\\`, which is
copied out to a FAT hard disk this tool makes. Nothing is written to the
image, and the game never needs the disc at run time.

    tools/duke-guest-test.py                    # General MIDI, the default
    tools/duke-guest-test.py --disc <cue|iso> --seconds 60
    tools/duke-guest-test.py --run "DIR D:\\"      # a DOS command instead of the game
    tools/duke-guest-test.py --setup --keys …   # drive SETUP.EXE by hand

**What is proven, and what is not** (2026-09-09):

* `--music gm` runs from nothing — it extracts the game, builds the
  disk, drives SETUP.EXE once for a config, and the game plays: the
  device reports ~1000 bytes and 300-450 note-ons per 5 s across 5 to 8
  MIDI channels, and 70 s of the recording is audible.
* The OPL3 plays this game too, measured the same way (2466 register
  writes and 516 key-ons in 5 s), but **only when SETUP.EXE launches the
  game itself** after picking its *AdLib* entry. Started from a batch
  file with the same config patched in, the game answers "Couldn't find
  selected sound card" — with `MusicDevice = 2`, with `MidiPort` at
  0x388 as its own SETUP writes it, and with `BLASTER` exported. That is
  the game's configuration and not the device (the `midi-guest` battery
  and the `music` check both drive the same OPL3 from a standing start),
  and it is why `--music fm` is not a one-command mode here. Its *Sound
  Blaster* music entry, as opposed to *AdLib*, refuses on every path
  tried, even with the FM chip mirrored at the card's own 2x8 where a
  real SB Pro or 16 decodes it.

Outputs in build/duke-guest/. Local only (it needs the disc), never in
scripts/test.sh.

# `MidiPort` goes with the device and is not only the MPU's: the AdLib
# entry probes the *FM* chip at whatever this says, so a config that
