# through tools/win98-game-test.sh (the user's image is never written), wait
# for 3DMark's welcome dialog by its pixels (a fixed sleep missed it once the
# boot got faster), click New Benchmark and Benchmark over a USB tablet,

# placed by test, from a screendump every 5 s in tests/: that is where a
# game test's frame rate is read, never off a bare rate line, whose window
# can be a loading screen or the CPU 3D Speed test -- the 2026-09-12
