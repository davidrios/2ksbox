"""A gamepad as a *guest* meets it (M13, docs/tracks/m13-gamepads.md) —
both devices, each in the family it is for.

    tools/pad-guest-test.py                 # path B: the gameport, FreeDOS
    tools/pad-guest-test.py xp [image]      # path A: the USB HID pad, XP
    tools/pad-guest-test.py win98 [machine|image]     # path A on Windows 98
    tools/pad-guest-test.py win98 claude98            # ...a launcher machine
    tools/pad-guest-test.py --verbose ...   # ...and every sample line
    UNTHROTTLED=1 tools/pad-guest-test.py   # the DOS control: no -icount

Both paths were confirmed by hand with a real controller (a DualSense, on
2026-09-09/10) and neither was guarded by anything afterwards. This is
what re-checks them: seen to work once is not the same as kept working,
and the two guest ends are exactly the parts no host-side check can reach.

**It must be the player, not `qemu-system-i386`.** The pad reaches a guest
through the embed library (`qemu_embed_pad_state` -> the input bottom half
-> `usb_gamepad_set_state` / `gameport_set_state`), and only the player
drives that; a bare QEMU has pad devices that nothing ever moves.
`PLAYER_PAD_SCRIPT` stands in for the controller, so this runs on a
machine with nothing plugged in — which is the whole reason that source
exists.

The poses are the same on both paths, and each moves **one** control, so
nothing here has to align the guest's clock with the host's frame counter
and the order the samples arrive in does not matter. What the two guests
are then asked is deliberately *opposite* in one place, which is the point
of running both:

    control          gameport (path B)        USB HID (path A)
    left stick X     axis 1                   X
    the d-pad        axis 1 and 2 (folded)    the POV hat, and nothing else
    right stick X    axis 3                   Z
    face buttons     the four button bits     buttons 1-4

The d-pad row is the one to watch. A gameport has only pots, so a digital
pad has to drive the axes to their ends or a DOS game cannot read it at
all; a HID pad has a hat, and driving the axes from it as well would make
a stick the guest cannot centre. The same host state has to produce both.

On the Windows paths every sample is read through **two** APIs, because a
title of the era can call either: DirectInput, and winmm's `joyGetPosEx`
on top of 9x's VJOYD. That second column is not a curiosity — it is what
closed M13's last item. A Windows game on 98 was going to need the
gameport's driver half ("Standard Game Port" through Add New Hardware) to
see a joystick at all; it does not, because the USB pad arrives through
winmm as well, which `check_winmm` now asserts with the same force as the
DirectInput half rather than leaving in a log for someone to read once.

Outputs in build/pad-guest/. Local only — the DOS run fetches the FreeDOS
floppy `tools/x87-guest-test.py` uses, the Windows runs want one of the
user's own images, and all of them want a display for the player's window.
All three are in `scripts/test.sh`'s guest stage as `pad-guest`,
`pad-guest-xp` and `pad-guest-98`; the last skips rather than fails where
the launcher machine it names does not exist, since no suite can assume
someone's library looks like this one.
