# cdaudio-guest-test.sh — CD-DA through a guest's own MCI, on both Windows
# families (doc 17 §5.4, §6.3):
#
#   tools/cdaudio-guest-test.sh ~/vms/win98.qcow2 win98
#   tools/cdaudio-guest-test.sh ~/vms/winxp.qcow2 xp
#
# `CDTEST.EXE` lists the tracks, plays track 2, pauses, resumes and **stops**,
# and asks MCI for the mode after each. The point of this tool is the last
# one: *how* a family's `mcicda` stops a drive is not the same command on 9x
# and NT, and a drive that answers one of them and not the other plays on
# after the Stop button. So the run is always traced (`CDIMAGE_TRACE=1`) and
# prints the packets around the stop — the guest's own words, rather than an
# assumption about them.
#
# The drive's audiodev is a wav file, so what the guest played is on the host
# afterwards. The disc is the selftest's mixed-mode one (track 1 data, tracks
# 2-3 audio, a 1 kHz tone in track 2) unless DISC= names another; the guest
# writes `cdtest.log` to the floppy it booted the batch from, which is how it
# comes back on a machine with no writable disk of its own.
#
# The image is never written: everything goes to a qcow2 overlay under
# build/cdaudio-guest. Local only (needs a guest image), so not in
# scripts/test.sh. The boot is not slept out (tools/guestwait.sh).
# Env: OUT=dir, DISC=cue, DRIVE=D, PLAY=6 (seconds of track 2),
#      BOOT_WAIT=s (the cap, 300), NO_KVM=1, KEEP=1.
