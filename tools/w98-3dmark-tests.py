"""Place a 3DMark 99 run's rate lines by test (tools/w98-3dmark.sh).

The executor's `ddi: N frames/s` and the device's `N page flips in X s`
lines are windows on their own clocks: a line prints on the first frame
5 s after the previous one, so a window with no frames in it (a test's
loading screen, the "Synthetic CPU 3D Speed" test, which presents about
two frames a second) stretches until the next frame and its "frames/s" is
a count over mostly empty time. On 2026-09-11/12 a 14 s window of that
kind was read as "the first-person test" for a whole day; the test itself
had been at the 60 Hz cap all along (docs/tracks/m9-tcg-aarch64.md, the
"Win98 3D" correction).

So the tests are told from the screen instead: w98-3dmark.sh screendumps
every 5 s after the Benchmark click into tests/t<secs>.png, and this
classifies each one by pixels -- 3DMark's "Now testing" splash (the orange
logo block and the blue banner), the score dialog (the project window's
grey under the dialog's blue title bar), or a game frame (anything else).
The first-person test is known by the green frame counter it draws
top-left, the race is the run of game frames right before it (the two
load too fast for a splash shot to separate them), and a rate line counts
for a test only when its whole window lies inside that test's shots.
