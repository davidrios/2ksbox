# Wine's d3d8 / d3d9 conformance tests (track M16) in a Win98 guest, through
# Win98's own DirectX 9.0c runtime on the display driver. The 9x counterpart
# of `tools/xp-driver-test.sh <image> winetest`.
#
#   tools/win98-winetest.sh [image.qcow2]      # default: the base98-br machine
#
# guest-tools/build-winetests.sh first (build/winetest/out) and
# guest-tools/build-driver9x.sh (the driver is re-staged every run by
# tools/win98-game-test.sh, which boots the machine). The tests go to C:\WT,
# RUN.BAT runs each file under WTRUN's time cap, WTRUN writes
# C:\2KSBOX\WINETEST, and the batch's last line tells COM1 "WTALL", which
# ends the run. The folder comes back to OUT/winetest and
# tools/winetest-summary.py prints the table.
#
# Env:
#   WT_TESTS="d3d9:visual d3d8:device"  a subset (default: every file, the
#                       device files last, as on XP)
#   WT_CAP=s            WTRUN's cap per file (3600: TCG)
#   WT_BASELINE=f       a verdict against reference/winetest/<f>.txt (or a path);
#                       w98-driver is the driver's Win98 baseline
#   WT_SAVE=f           save this run as a baseline
#   RUN_SECS=s          the whole run's cap (6 h)
#   RAW=, FRESH=1, OUT=, DDFLAGS=  as tools/win98-game-test.sh
#
# **Win98 runs under TCG** (CLAUDE.md), so a full run takes hours; a subset
# is the edit-test loop.
