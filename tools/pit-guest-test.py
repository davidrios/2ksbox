"""The PIT as a DOS game's clock meets it (patch 34): guest-tools'
QCLOCK.COM — DOS Quake's Sys_FloatTime, the BIOS tick word plus PIT
counter 0 in mode 2, read in a tight loop beside the TSC — under FreeDOS,
twice: on this QEMU as built, and with `-global isa-pit.overdue-irq=off`,
upstream's behaviour, as the control.

What it guards: QEMU computes the counter from the clock at every read,
but raises the IRQ 0 edge at the counter's wrap from a timer the main loop
runs a wakeup late. A read in that gap sees the counter wrapped and the
tick not yet counted — time going backward — and Quake counts a backward
step as nothing while taking it as its new reference, so the whole period
is counted again when the tick lands. Measured 2026-09-10 before the
patch: one full 55 ms backward step on every tick, 540 of 540, Quake's
clock at exactly 200 % in every window. With it, a port access delivers
the overdue edge first, and that must read as no backward step at all and
every window at 100 %.

The control is reported, not required: whether the gap is ever hit
depends on how late this host's main loop wakes, so a host where it is not
is one where this check cannot fail — said out loud, not failed.
