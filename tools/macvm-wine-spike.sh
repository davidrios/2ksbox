# The M15 spike inside a macOS guest (docs/tracks/m15-wine-executor.md,
# ADR-019): a pre-26 macOS in a UTM virtual machine on this Mac stands in
# for the community build's user — no Vulkan 1.3, so the executor has to
# run on Wine — and this drives the two host tests through the Windows
# build of the executor on Wine's own d3d9 *in that guest*, over ssh, and
# diffs the frames it drew against the DXVK frames this host made.
#
#   tools/macvm-wine-spike.sh <user>@<guest ip>        # utmctl ip-address <vm> gives the ip
#   RENDERER=vulkan …                                   # wined3d's Vulkan renderer (MoltenVK) instead of GL
#
# It expects, on this host, what the spike already made:
#   build/wine/wine-staging-*-osx64.tar.xz   WineHQ's macOS build (x86_64)
#   build/wine-spike/d3dpt_exec.dll          scripts/build-d3dpt-exec.sh --windows
#   build/wine-spike/d3dpt-dp2-test.exe      the display driver's host test, mingw build
#   build/wine-spike/d3dpt-exec-test.exe     the DLL path's host test, mingw build
#   build/wine-spike/libwinpthread-1.dll     Homebrew's mingw links it dynamically
#   build/test/dp2-test.bmp, build/wine-spike/final-native.bmp   the DXVK frames (the oracle)
# and, in the guest, done once by hand: an account logged in at the
# console with Remote Login on, Rosetta installed (`softwareupdate
# --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`, it wants an administrator), and
# passwordless sudo for that account (`echo 'USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
# | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/USER`) — because Wine has to run *in the
# guest's GUI session*: a process started over ssh has no window server,
# wined3d cannot make even its capability-probe window, and the only way
# from ssh into that session is `launchctl asuser`, which is root's.
#
# What this found on 2026-09-22 (macOS 15.6.1 guest, WineHQ 11.17, the
# Air): Apple's paravirtual GPU has Metal and no accelerated OpenGL —
# CGL offers "Apple Software Renderer" only, to arm64 and x86_64 alike —
# and Wine's Mac driver demands kCGLPFAAccelerated for its bootstrap
# context (winemac.drv/opengl.c init_context; AllowSoftwareRendering only
# widens the list it enumerates afterwards), so **Wine has no OpenGL in
# such a guest at all** and wined3d's GL renderer, the community build's
# path, cannot be tested in a VM. The VM answers the Vulkan-renderer
# question instead (RENDERER=vulkan: MoltenVK sees the paravirtual GPU,
# the DDI frame differs from DXVK's in 8 % of pixels and the DLL path's
# device creation fails on a depth format), which is not the plan. The GL
# path's test is a real pre-26 macOS: a second APFS volume on this Mac.
