# w98-moto.sh -- Moto Racer 1997 into a practice race on a Win98 machine,
# headless, and its frame rate (docs/22 §6; the 9x counterpart of
# tools/xp-moto-race.sh): a raw copy of the image through
# tools/win98-game-test.sh, MOTO.EXE from RUN.BAT with the disc on ide.1,
# the menus walked state by state -- every 6 s the screen is classified by
# tools/motoracer-state.py and the one action for that screen taken (Start
# on the title, the name accepted, Play Solo, Practice, Time Attack off,
# Continue (Speed Bay, 3 laps), Start in the showroom; Esc leaves the intro
# and anything unknown), because a fresh install and base98-us show the
# screens in different orders -- the throttle held, and the rate read from the adapter: the
# `N page flips in 5.0 s` and `ddi: N frames/s` lines whose windows lie
# inside the throttle window (both are Moto Racer's own frames, presented
# through the driver's flip chain; the game has no frame cap of its own).
# The clicks walk the PS/2 pointer (no tablet on this machine); inside the
# game the pointer sprite is the game's, so the walk is blind from the
# top-left corner -- which is why every step is checked.
