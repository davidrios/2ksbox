# w98-quake2.sh -- Quake II's software renderer timedemo on a Win98 machine,
# headless (docs/22 §6): a raw copy of the image through
# tools/win98-game-test.sh, the disc on ide.1 (a minimal install reads its
# pak files off the CD: quake2.exe scans the drives for INSTALL\DATA), and
# from RUN.BAT `quake2.exe +set vid_ref soft +set sw_mode 3 +set logfile 2
# +timedemo 1 +map demo1.dm2` -- 640x480 software rendering, the console
# logged and flushed to BASEQ2\QCONSOLE.LOG, demo1 played as fast as the
# machine can. The number is the game's own "N frames, S seconds: F fps"
# line, pulled off the disk afterwards; the screendumps every 5 s show the
# demo running. Quake II is the CPU benchmark of its day, and its software
# renderer is x87 and integer code with no 3D device in the path.
