# The M15 spike on a *second macOS on this Mac* (ADR-019's community build's
# user: a pre-26 macOS, no Vulkan 1.3, the real GPU), run from a Terminal
# booted into that macOS — not over ssh: one machine runs one macOS at a
# time, and this one mounts the other volume's checkout under /Volumes.
# tools/macvm-wine-spike.sh is the same idea for a VM, and a VM turned out
# to have no accelerated OpenGL for Wine at all; this is the real test.
#
#   cd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD - Data/Users/<you>/work/win-98-xp-virt"   # the 26 volume's checkout
#   tools/macos-wine-spike-local.sh
#
# Needs, in that checkout, what scripts/build.sh made on the other macOS
# (nothing here links Homebrew, so it all runs on a bare install):
#   build/d3dpt-dp2-test, build/d3dpt-exec-test          the two host tests
#   build/d3dpt/libd3dpt_exec_remote.dylib               QEMU's side of the transport
#   build/d3dpt/wine/d3dpt_exec.dll + d3dpt-exec-host.exe   the pair the Wine process runs
#   build/wine/wine-staging-*-osx64.tar.xz               WineHQ's macOS build (x86_64)
#   build/test/dp2-test.bmp, build/test/exec-test.bmp     the DXVK frames (the oracle)
# and, on this macOS, Rosetta: `softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
# (a fresh install has none; no sudo needed). A bare install has no python3
# either — /usr/bin/python3 is the Command Line Tools' stub, which asks to
# install them — so the diff runs on `$PYTHON`, else a python3 that answers,
# else uv's own CPython from the checkout owner's home on the other volume.
#
# It unpacks Wine beside the tarball if that has not been done, keeps its
# prefix in build/wine-prefix-<macOS version>, runs both host tests through
# the executor in the Wine process with wined3d's GL renderer, and diffs
# the frames. The two answers this macOS gives and the other cannot: the
# GL_RENDERER line (the real GPU's GL, for a Rosetta process) and the fps.
