#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dirdisc-guest-test.sh — a host folder in a guest's CD-ROM drive (M5g,
# docs/tracks/m5-dirdisc.md), on the families xp-cdimage-test.sh does not
# cover:
#
#   tools/dirdisc-guest-test.sh ~/vms/win98.qcow2 win98
#   tools/dirdisc-guest-test.sh ~/vms/winxp.qcow2 xp
#
# The machine boots with `-cdrom isodir:<dir>` — no image anywhere — and a
# floppy carrying RUN.BAT, which lists the disc and reads files off it
# through the guest's own file system driver, over COM1. That is the
# proof: the names in the listing and the bytes of the files are what
# libdisc generated from the tree as the guest asked for them.
#
# The folder is deliberately awkward in the ways a user's own folder is:
# a long name, a space in a directory name, a file of exactly one sector
# and one a byte over, an empty file, and a nested directory.
#
# The image is never written: everything goes to a qcow2 overlay under
# build/dirdisc-guest. Local only (needs a guest image), so not in
# scripts/test.sh. The boot is not slept out: the run knocks on the Run
# dialog until the guest answers over COM1 (tools/guestwait.sh).
#
# BIG=1 asks a different question: where does *this guest's* file system
# stop? The folder is then sparse filler with a small marker file after
# each interesting offset — an 80-minute CD (703 MiB, where the drive
# starts reporting a DVD-ROM profile), a 99-minute one (878 MiB, past
# every MSF address), 2 GiB, 4 GiB and a nearly full DVD-9 — and each
# marker the guest can `type` back is proof its driver reached that
# offset. Costs no host disk: the filler is never written.
#
# Env: OUT=dir, BOOT_WAIT=s (the cap on that wait, 300), NO_KVM=1, KEEP=1,
#      BIG=1, MARKS="703 878 2048 4096 8000" (MiB, overrides the offsets).
