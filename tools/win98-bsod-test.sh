# win98-bsod-test.sh — a Windows 98 blue screen has to be *visible* on the
# d3dpt-vga adapter (doc 19 §29, M10).
#
#   tools/win98-bsod-test.sh ~/.local/share/2ksbox/machines/test98/disk.qcow2
#
# Why this is a test at all: a 9x blue screen — a fatal exception, a
# "Windows protection error", the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen — is drawn by the main
# VDD in VGA text mode, which it programs itself with no int 10h and no
# display driver drawing. Our adapter scans out the linear frame buffer
# while ENABLE is set, and until the mini-VDD hooked the VDD's screen switch
# nothing turned it off, so every blue screen this driver produced for its
# first three days was invisible: the machine "hung on a glitched desktop"
# while a message asking for a key sat in VRAM behind it (doc 19 §15 is the
# archaeology of reading them out afterwards; the user's "BSODs don't show
# up" of 2026-09-09 is the same thing seen from the chair). The mini-VDD
# turns the linear frame buffer off on PRE_HIRES_TO_VGA and on
# SAVE_MESSAGE_MODE_STATE, and this is what proves a blue screen is seen.
#
# What it does: boots a raw copy of the image on our adapter with the
# freshly built driver (tools/win98-game-test.sh does the staging), makes
# Windows blue-screen from RUN.BAT by running BSOD.EXE (guest-tools/src/
# d3dptvid/w9x/bsod.c), which loads BSODVXD.VXD (bsodvxd.c) — a dynamic VxD
# of ours whose init executes an invalid opcode in ring 0, so the VMM puts
# up "exception 06 in VxD BSODVXD(01)". (It tries the famous `C:\con\con`
# first; that is patched on the test image, and from a DOS box it only
# ends the DOS box anyway.) Then it reads the VGA text page out of VRAM
# while the screen is up, presses a key, and requires all of:
#
#   1. the VxD's `hi-res -> VGA` (or `message mode`) line after the desktop
#      came up and the device's `linear mode off` after it — a hook fired
#      and the adapter went back to its VGA core. Measured: a VxD's fatal
#      exception takes the ordinary screen switch (PRE_HIRES_TO_VGA + the
#      INT 2Fh notification); SAVE_MESSAGE_MODE_STATE is the DDK's door for
#      message screens that skip the switch, called once at boot as well;
#   2. a screendump taken meanwhile that is mostly the blue screen's blue,
#      which is what a person at the window would see (a screendump shows
#      what is scanned out: with ENABLE on it would show the desktop);
#   3. the text page naming a VxD or the 0028: selector, i.e. the blue
#      screen is a real exception screen and not some other text mode;
#   4. `linear mode on` again after the key, and a last screendump that is
#      not blue — "press any key to attempt to continue" continued, the
#      desktop came back, and the machine powers off on the button.
#
# Env: RAW=, OUT=, BOOT_WAIT=, everything win98-game-test.sh takes;
# TRIGGER= replaces the RUN.BAT body and STAGE= the file staged for it (a
# different way to blue-screen). The user's own player often holds the
# image's lock: RAW=build/w98game/guest.raw FRESH=0 reuses the copy the
# game harness made.
#
# Overlay/copy only, never the image. Local only (needs a guest image), not
# in scripts/test.sh.
