"""The music devices as a *guest* meets them (doc 20 §7, M12): a DOS
program detects the OPL3 the way an AdLib driver does, plays a 440 Hz
note on it, then resets an MPU-401, puts it in UART mode and plays A4
through it — and the evidence is the **wav QEMU's own audio backend
recorded**, not the program's own opinion.

Two boots, one per device, because each is checked by the same question
("is there a 440 Hz note in this file?") and one file with two notes in
it cannot answer it twice. The serial log says what the guest saw at the
ports; `synthx wavtone` says whether anything came out.

    tools/midi-guest-test.py            # needs nasm, mtools, build/qemu
    tools/midi-guest-test.py opl        # one of them only
    tools/midi-guest-test.py mpu

Outputs in build/midi-guest/. Local only (it fetches the FreeDOS floppy
`tools/x87-guest-test.py` uses), not wired into scripts/test.sh — the
`music` check there proves the same devices from the monitor in seconds,
and this proves the half that check cannot: that a *guest* driving them
through its own I/O instructions finds them.
