# Build the Win98/Me display driver for the d3dpt-vga adapter (doc 19,
# ADR-012 / M10): the 16-bit DIB Engine mini display driver d3dpt9x.drv and
# its INF, staged as guest-tools/out/driver9x/.
#
# Unlike everything else in guest-tools/, this needs **Open Watcom**, not
# mingw-w64: the target is a 16-bit NE module (and later a ring-0 VxD), and
# mingw can produce neither format. Point WATCOM at an installed tree —
#
#   WATCOM=$HOME/.local/opt/open-watcom guest-tools/build-driver9x.sh
#
# — or install one where this script looks by default. Open Watcom v2 ships
# host binaries for all of our machines in one tarball:
# https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2 (the Last-CI-build release's
# ow-snapshot.tar.xz unpacks ready to use, Linux x86-64 in binl64 and macOS
# arm64 in armo64), so this builds on the Air as well as on the rig.
#
# The headers this builds against are in src/d3dptvid/ddk9x/ — no Microsoft
# DDK, same rule as the XP driver (doc 15). dibeng.lib is made here by wlib
# from a text import list, so the DIB Engine needs no DDK either.

# The ring-3 HAL DLL. This one is *not* Watcom's: on 9x the DirectDraw /
# Direct3D HAL is an ordinary user-mode Win32 DLL loaded into the game's
# own process (doc 19 §1), so it builds with the same i686 mingw-w64 the
# XP driver and the guest wrappers use — and it is the only 9x binary
# that links the OS-independent core. A host with no mingw still gets a
# working display driver; it just gets no DirectDraw with it, and says so.
#
# Note the include path: *not* $DDK. Those are the 16-bit interface
# headers, full of `__far`; the 32-bit DirectDraw driver headers
# (ddrawi.h, d3dhal.h, dmemmgr.h) are ones mingw-w64 ships itself, and
# they are the ones this half wants.
HALCC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
# **Above 2 GiB, and that is not a preference.** DirectDraw loads this DLL
# and calls DriverInit in `DDHELP.EXE`, not in the application — so the
# callback addresses it publishes are flat pointers in DDHELP's address
# space, and the HALINFO validator that IsBadCodePtr's them runs in the
# *game's*. Windows 9x maps a DLL based in the shared arena (0x80000000 -
# 0xBFFFFFFF) at one address for every process, which is what makes one
# set of pointers mean the same thing in both; a DLL based below that is
# private to whoever loaded it and every callback it publishes is a bad
# pointer everywhere else. The symptom is a HAL that is refused with no
# message at all (doc 19 §22). The reference driver bases its at
# 0xB00B0000 for the same reason, and this is deliberately its
# neighbourhood.
#
# **The address has to be one this Windows will actually give.** A base
# it will not honour is relocated into the private arena instead, and the
# DLL then publishes callbacks no other process can reach; 0xB3D00000 and
# 0xB00D0000 both came back as 0x00b50000 on this guest (2026-09-08), and
# stripping the relocation table to force the issue only turned that into
# `LoadLibrary` failing outright. So the value is the reference driver's
# own, which is known to load on a 9x guest — and `DriverInit` checks the
# base it actually got and says so rather than running on a bad one.
