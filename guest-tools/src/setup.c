/*
 * setup.c: SETUP.EXE, the guest-tools installer, run inside the machine.
 *
 * Which files go where differs per Windows family, and one of them
 * (FXPTL.SYS) needs a service registered before OPENGL32.DLL will load.
 * SETUP installs the components that apply to *this* Windows and logs
 * what happened.
 *
 * Guest tools come in two kinds and so does this program:
 *
 *   - things installed into Windows (system files, a driver, a service),
 *     the numbered list and `I`;
 *   - things copied next to one game's EXE (our D3D DLLs, the GL wrapper,
 *     the Glide DLLs), `G`. Those are per-game by design, never system-wide, so
 *     an installer with only an install step would leave out half the ISO.
 *
 * A console program on purpose. It is the one interface Windows 98, XP
 * and a rescue command prompt all have, it needs no common controls, and
 * every step is scriptable. `SETUP /ALL` in a batch file is how our own
 * headless guest tests install the tools.
 *
 * Everything it installs comes from the folder SETUP.EXE is in, so it
 * works from the CD, from a copy on the hard disk, or from a share.

 * The binaries go beside the INF because that is where Windows looks for a

 * the driver has been proven in. The INF's own CopyFiles should make the
 * second set redundant; it costs a few kilobytes not to find out the hard
 * way on somebody's machine.
 *
 * The restart is required. Nothing of this driver exists to Windows until
 * the boot that enumerates the adapter against the new INF, and on a
 * reinstall every file that is already
 * there is swapped by that boot rather than overwritten under the driver
 * that is drawing the desktop (stage_set). */

 *
 * A driver's caps name is a fixed 32 bytes and nothing makes it end in a
 * NUL. Windows 98's SB16.VXD builds it as "%s [%x]", its own string and
 * the card's port, and the Portuguese one's wave-in string is 27
 * characters, so "Entrada de som wave da SB16 [220]" is 33 and arrives
 * cut to 32 with no terminator. DirectX 9.0c's DSOUND.DLL copies the wave
 * names into a 32-byte stack buffer under a /GS cookie, so whatever
 * enumerates DirectSound (dxdiag, every game) dies with c0000409 inside
 * DSOUND.DLL. Nothing on the host can change that string; the fault is
 * the same on every host, and on a real Portuguese Win98 with a real SB16.
 *
 * The VxD has a door for it: at start it reads WaveInDevName /
 * WaveOutDevName from HKLM\SOFTWARE\Creative Tech\DeviceInfo\<enumerator>
 * \<hardware ID> and uses them instead of its own strings. The key is
 * named the way SB16.VXD names it: the device ID's first component, then
 * the devnode's HardwareID without its '*' and cut at the first ','. For
 * the card QEMU's sb16 is detected as it is DeviceInfo\ROOT\PNPB003.
 * A name is written only for a device whose name did not end within its
 * 32 bytes, and only on the Creative driver that reads it; the VxD reads
 * it at boot, hence the restart. */

 * 4.10.2222: ExitWindowsEx from a console process never returns and no
 * shutdown begins at all. There is no dialog, the desktop is untouched, and
 * the machine is still up five minutes later. The thread stuck inside it
 * holds the Win16Mutex, so pumping messages does not rescue it either: a
 * second thread pumping while a first one calls goes down with it, and the
 * whole process is then deaf to USER. The console costs the process its
 * own message queue (a console app's window belongs to the DOS box hosting
 * it, not to us). The same call from a process started with
 * DETACHED_PROCESS, which has no console at all, restarts the machine
 * cleanly. That process is this one again, run as `SETUP /REBOOTNOW`, so
 * the disc carries no second binary for it.
 *
 * Variants that do not work:
 * `rundll32 shell32.dll,SHExitWindowsEx 2` does nothing; `rundll32
 * krnl386.exe,exitkernel` does bring Windows down, but as a forced exit that
 * leaves the FAT dirty and the next boot in ScanDisk. */
