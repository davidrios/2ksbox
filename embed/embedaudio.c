/*
 * embedaudio.c — QEMU audio backend that clips the mixed guest output
 * straight into a caller-owned SPSC ring buffer (libqemu_embed.h:
 * qemu_embed_set_audio_ring). Launch with:
 *   -audiodev embed,id=snd0,out.frequency=48000,out.channels=2,out.format=s16
 *                   [,out.buffer-length=40000]
 * fixed_settings (default) yields exactly one HWVoiceOut in that format.
 *
 * Producer (QEMU main loop, BQL held, one mixer tick every timer-period =
 * 10 ms) advances wr; consumer (host audio thread, the DAC's clock) advances
 * rd. Indices are byte positions in [0, size) with one slot kept free; size
 * must be a power of two.
 *
 * Pacing. The guest is drained at the pace of its own clock and never in a
 * burst, because a sound card's DMA moves exactly as far as it is drained:
 * QEMU's sb16 and AC97 copy what the mixer asks for out of the guest's
 * buffer and move the guest's play cursor by as much, and a driver that
 * writes a margin ahead of that cursor (DirectSound's scheme; a DOS game's
 * double buffer is the same with a bigger margin) plays what it has not
 * written yet as soon as the cursor jumps further than its margin. That was
 * the crackle (tools/audio-glitch-test.py): this backend used to top the
 * ring up to its target on every tick, so a host device that drains the
 * ring a whole period at a time — 1024 frames from PipeWire, 2048 when
 * another client asks for it, 4096 from plain ALSA hardware — pulled the
 * guest ahead by up to that much at once, and the surplus that followed was
 * trimmed by dropping whole ticks, each drop a click of its own.
 *
 * So each tick takes what the guest's clock says has played since the last
 * one, times a small correction. A main loop that ran late — no call at all
 * for longer than a tick and a half — loses the excess instead of jerking
 * the guest forward (the guest's cursor simply stood still meanwhile), and
 * no more than three ticks are ever owed, so a card that paused its DMA
 * does not come back to a burst. The correction holds
 * the ring's *minimum* over a quarter second at out.buffer-length — the
 * cushion under the consumer's own pull, whatever its period — by draining
 * the guest up to 25 % fast or 10 % slow. The host DAC's drift against the
 * guest's clock is parts per million, so in steady state the correction is
 * nil; after a stall it refills the cushion within about a second, a
 * fraction of a millisecond per tick, which no guest driver can tell from
 * its own clock. Starting a stream is the consumer's side: it waits until
 * the ring holds the cushion plus one of its own periods before it plays
 * (player/src/audio.rs), because this side will not hurry the guest to fill
 * it.
