//! Reading a host gamepad (M13 step 0, `docs/tracks/m13-gamepads.md`).
//!
//! This is the *whole* host end and nothing else: enumerate what is
//! plugged in, notice what is unplugged, turn whatever the platform calls
//! its buttons into the abstract [`Control`]s the `gamepad` crate
//! defines, and shape the analog readings. What those controls then
//! *mean* for a machine is not decided here — that is `launcher-core`'s
//! (ADR-014), and reaches the player as arguments.
//!
//! Two sources behind one interface:
//!
//! * [`Gilrs`] — real hardware, through one crate that covers evdev on
//!   Linux, XInput and DirectInput on Windows and IOKit on macOS.
//! * [`Script`] — `PLAYER_PAD_SCRIPT`, a recorded sequence replayed
//!   against the guest's own frame counter.
//!
//! The second is not a convenience. No machine that runs
//! `scripts/test.sh` has a controller plugged into it, so without a
//! synthetic pad every check in this track would need a person and a
//! device, and the project's testing policy — integration and end-to-end
//! only, and wired into the suite so it guards against regressions —
//! could not be met at all. It is the piece the rest of M13 is built on,
//! which is why step 0 exists.
