//! Mode analysis (doc 03, "Pixel accuracy rules" 2 and 3): what a guest
//! framebuffer size meant on a monitor of the era, and what the CRT presets
//! have to be told about it.
//!
//! Two facts the framebuffer itself does not carry:
//!
//! * **Pixel aspect.** 320x200 is a 4:3 picture drawn with pixels taller
//!   than they are wide, not a 1.6:1 one. The geometry stage takes the
//!   aspect from here, never from width/height (rule 2).
//! * **Scanline count.** A real VGA double-scans its short modes: the CRTC
//!   repeats every row so 320x200 lands on the standard 400-line raster.
//!   A scanline shader handed a 200-line surface draws 200 fat scanlines
//!   where the tube drew 400 (rule 3), so it has to be told.
//!
//! The table is the exception list. A mode not in it is taken to have square
//! pixels, which is right for every SVGA mode and for anything modern a guest
//! might set: forcing 4:3 on an unlisted size would distort a widescreen one,
//! and every 4:3 mode that *does* have square pixels comes out at 4:3 from
//! that rule anyway. What the table has to carry is the modes where the two
//! disagree -- the VGA's 200-, 240-, 350- and 400-line modes, whose pixels
//! are not square -- plus a name for each, and the place a correction goes
//! when one is measured against the reference CRT (doc 09).
//!
//! Two things are rules rather than entries, because a table of exact sizes
//! cannot state them. Double-scanning: the CRTC sets its bit below ~300
//! lines. And the VGA raster itself (`vga_raster`) -- a size at one of the
//! four VGA widths and at most 480 lines is a 4:3 picture whether or not its
//! line count is one of the round ones, because a guest can scan any number
//! of lines onto that one raster and QEMU's text path does not even report
//! the number it scanned (720x396 for a 400-line raster with a 12-line
//! character cell, which is XP's text-mode setup).
