//! The host's keyboard shortcuts go to the guest while the player window
//! has focus: the Windows key opens the *guest's* Start menu, and Super+1
//! reaches the game instead of switching the host's workspace.
//!
//! winit has no keyboard grab, so this is one piece per windowing system:
//!
//! - **Wayland**: `zwp_keyboard_shortcuts_inhibit_manager_v1`. One
//!   inhibitor for the window's whole life. The compositor applies it only
//!   while the surface has keyboard focus, which is exactly the rule wanted,
//!   so focus changes need nothing from us. The compositor may still keep a
//!   binding of its own (sway's `bindsym --inhibited`, GNOME asks the user
//!   once), which is the user's way out and not ours to take.
//! - **X11**: an active `XGrabKeyboard` while focused. An active grab beats
//!   the window manager's passive ones on Super.
//! - **Windows**: the keyboard registered for raw input with
//!   `RIDEV_NOHOTKEYS`, which stops the shell acting on the two Windows keys
//!   (and so on every Win+ shortcut) while a window of this process is the
//!   foreground one. The key still arrives at the window as an ordinary
//!   `WM_KEYDOWN`, so winit delivers it and the guest gets it down the same
//!   path as every other key. This takes the key from the shell without
//!   taking it from us, and it needs no hook, no thread and no injection.
//!   **Ctrl+Esc comes with them.** It is a keyboard hotkey the shell acts
//!   on, so it stops with the rest and opens the *guest's* Start menu. It
//!   does not cover what Windows calls a *system* hotkey (Alt+Tab, Alt+Esc,
//!   Alt+F4, Alt+Space, Ctrl+Alt+Del, Win+L), which no program gets. Hence
//!   the player's Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D for Ctrl+Alt+Del, and Alt+F4 asking
//!   before it stops the machine.
//!
//!   **This used to be a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook, and the hook never
//!   worked.** Measured on the user's PC, a low-level keyboard hook in the
//!   player is called for every key on the machine *except* while the
//!   player's own window is the foreground one, the only time it is
//!   wanted: zero calls, not late ones, with the hook installed and its
//!   thread answering. A hook in a third process saw those same keys, and a
//!   minimal program with a window and a hook of its own saw its own
//!   window's keys, so it is neither a Windows rule nor that window. What in
//!   this process does it was never found, and `RIDEV_NOHOTKEYS` makes the
//!   question moot. docs/03-display-pipeline.md, "Input path".
//! - **macOS**: the window server's hot key operating mode set to "all
//!   disabled except Universal Access" while the window has focus
//!   (`CGSSetGlobalHotKeyOperatingMode`, SkyLight's private interface, the
//!   call VirtualBox and UTM make for their keyboard capture; UTM ships it
//!   on the Mac App Store, and it works inside the App Sandbox): Cmd+Tab,
//!   Cmd+Space, Mission Control and the Spaces arrows (Ctrl+Up, which era
//!   games use), the screenshot chords and every other binding of the
//!   Keyboard settings pane stay out of the way and the keys arrive at the
//!   window as ordinary `keyDown:`s. The mode does not follow focus by
//!   itself, so the player sets it on focus and resets it on focus loss
//!   and on drop. The Universal Access chords are left on: accessibility
//!   is never the guest's. Two roads that do not work on macOS 26, both
//!   measured: the public Carbon `PushSymbolicHotKeyMode` is a stub (its
//!   own mode reads back as pushed while the window server's stays 0), and
//!   an active HID event tap with the Accessibility permission never sees
//!   these chords at all, sandboxed or not (the window server acts on them
//!   before any tap). `PLAYER_KEYBOARD_MAC=presentation` picks the public
//!   `NSApplicationPresentationOptions` instead, kept as the fallback
//!   should App Store review ever refuse the symbol: `disableProcessSwitching`
//!   (Cmd+Tab) and `disableHideApplication` (Cmd+H), which want the Dock
//!   auto-hidden while the app is active and cover nothing else. Cmd+H,
//!   Cmd+Opt+H and Cmd+Q are not hot keys but the app menu's key
//!   equivalents (winit's menu), which the menu would swallow before the
//!   window sees them; the capture blanks them for its life and gives them
//!   back on drop. **A Cmd+Q that reaches the window asks** (`main.rs`,
//!   like Alt+F4): a hand that meant Win+Q loses nothing, one that meant
//!   Quit gets the prompt. What stays the host's: Cmd+Opt+Esc (Force Quit)
//!   and the fn / Touch Bar media keys, which are not hot keys of the pane.
//!
//!   **Cmd+Q never `exit()`s under a live QEMU thread.** winit's Quit item
//!   is `terminate:`, and its delegate answers no `applicationShouldTerminate:`,
//!   so AppKit would `exit()` from inside the run loop while the QEMU thread
//!   is alive (the atexit race `main.rs` joins the thread to avoid). The
//!   player adds that method to winit's delegate class at start
//!   (`quit_closes_window`): it closes the key window instead, which is the
//!   title bar's close, and cancels the terminate. The Dock's Quit and the
//!   menu's take the same road.
//!
//! **Ctrl+Alt+K** hands them back to the host and, pressed again, to the
//! guest again. The player drops the `Capture` and builds a new one, so
//! "off" is exactly the state before it was made. `PLAYER_KEYBOARD_CAPTURE=0`
//! starts a run with them the host's, and **`PLAYER_KEYBOARD_LOG=1`** makes
//! the Windows side say what it did: that the registration was accepted, and
//! what winit and Windows each thought about focus at every change. A
//! shortcut that still reaches the host is nearly always a window that was
//! not in front when it was pressed.
