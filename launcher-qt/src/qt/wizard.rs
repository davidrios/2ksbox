//! The guided creation wizard (doc 07), as a QObject over
//! `launcher_core::wizard::Form`.
//!
//! The form is the shared one: which defaults follow the family until
//! someone chooses otherwise, the per-family memory clamp, what
//! `build_machine` writes, what `submit` does differently when editing,
//! and the sentences under each row. None of that is here. What is here
//! is the projection onto Q_PROPERTYs, in both directions:
//!
//! * **`publish`** reads the form and writes every property through its
//!   generated setter. Never a direct field assignment — see the header
//!   of `main.rs` for the trap that closes.
//! * **`pull`** copies the plain, two-way-bound text fields back into
//!   the form. A QML `TextField` writes its property and nothing else,
//!   so the form is caught up before anything reads it (`submit`). The fields with a *consequence* never go this
//!   way: they have no writable property at all, only `choose_*`, which
//!   is what makes the "…_chosen" rule impossible to forget in a new
//!   widget.
//!
//! The combo boxes' labels come from the form's own enums
//! (`family_labels`, `accel_labels`, …) rather than being retyped in
//! QML, and so do the file dialog's name filters — the egui build gets
//! the same strings from the same constants.
