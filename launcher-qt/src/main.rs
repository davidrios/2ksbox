//! The companion launcher (doc 07) on Qt 6 / QML through cxx-qt, one of
//! the project's two maintained front ends — the other is `launcher/`
//! (egui). Both are views over the **same crate**: `launcher-core` holds
//! the bundle format, the machine library, the disc shelf, the snapshot
//! state machine, the wizard's form, the shader profile editor, the
//! preview's render path and every debug verb that needs no toolkit.
//!
//! So what is in this crate is Qt, and only Qt: a `QObject` per window
//! whose properties are a *projection* of a core model, a
//! `QAbstractListModel` wherever a core model has rows, and the views in
//! `qml/`. Nothing here decides anything about machines, discs or
//! shaders. When the two builds used to disagree — the wizard's
//! networking checkbox, the words under it, whether a new shader profile
//! kept its parameter overrides — it was always because a rule had been
//! written twice, and there is nowhere left to write one twice.
//!
//! It is deliberately **not** in the root workspace: `Cargo.toml`
//! declares its own, so `cargo build` at the repository root never
//! starts needing Qt 6 development files on the Mac, in CI or in the
//! Flatpak. Build it from this directory; that is the whole build
//! command, no CMake (`cxx-qt-build` finds Qt through `qmake6` and
//! drives `moc`/`qmltyperegistrar` itself).
//!
//! **The trap every bridge here is written around:** cxx-qt stores a
//! Q_PROPERTY *in* the Rust struct, and the generated setter is
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if self.field == value { return; }   // no binding loops
//! self.as_mut().rust_mut().field = value;
//! self.field_changed();
//! ```
//!
//! so writing a property's field directly and then "publishing" it with
//! its setter emits **nothing** — the setter sees the value already
//! there. Every window in the port opened once and then stopped
//! reacting because of exactly that. Keeping the state in a core model
//! *beside* the properties is what makes this safe by construction: a
//! `publish` reads the model and writes every property through its
//! setter, and the property fields are never assigned anywhere else.

// A windowed program on Windows, like the egui build: a console-subsystem
// binary opens a black terminal on every double-click. The debug verbs
// below still print — `main` borrows the console it was launched from
// when there is one (`launcher_core::console`).
