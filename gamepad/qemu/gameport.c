/*
 * gameport — the PC analog joystick port at 0x201 (M13 path B,
 * docs/tracks/m13-gamepads.md).
 *
 * Overlaid into hw/input/ by scripts/prepare-qemu.sh and built by
 * patch 27. QEMU has never had this port: nothing in hw/ answers 0x201,
 * and sb16.c models the DSP and mixer only — the gameport that sits at
 * 0x200-0x207 on a real Sound Blaster is not there. So a DOS game, which
 * reads the port itself and has no other way to find a joystick, found
 * nothing at all before this.
 *
 * A standalone ISA device rather than a member of one sound card, because
 * the family's card is a separate choice (bundle::Sound, doc 20) and a
 * joystick should not appear and vanish with it. On real hardware it was
 * usually on the card; here the bundle names it.
 *
 * The hardware is four RC one-shots and four buttons. A write to 0x201
 * triggers all four one-shots; a read returns bits 0-3 *set* while each
 * axis is still charging and bits 4-7 *clear* while each button is held.
 * The pulse is t = 24.2 us + 0.011 x R us over a 0-100 kohm pot, so 24 us
 * at one extreme and about 1124 us at the other. A game writes, then
 * counts loop iterations until the bit clears, and the count is the axis.
 *
 * No timer is needed for any of that, and none is used: the write records
 * a deadline per axis on QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL and a read compares against
 * it. Exact, and it costs nothing on a port nobody is polling.

 * The one-shot, in nanoseconds, for an axis byte.
 *
 * The byte is the pot's position, so 0x00 is 0 ohm and 0xff the full
 * 100 kohm: 24.2 us + 0.011 x (byte/255 x 100000) us. Integer nanoseconds
 * because a float here would be the only one in the device and the answer
 * is exact anyway.
 *
 * The polarity is the hardware's and needs no flip: a low byte is a short
 * pulse and a small count, which is what every game and every calibration
 * routine reads as left / up — and a low byte is what gamepad::hid_axis()
 * already gives for a stick pushed left or up.
