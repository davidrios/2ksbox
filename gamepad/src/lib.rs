//! The abstract gamepad: what a pad's controls are, and how a raw axis
//! becomes a decision (M13, `docs/tracks/m13-gamepads.md`).
//!
//! Its own crate, shared the way `shader-chain` is, because the two
//! crates that need it cannot depend on each other: `player` reads the
//! hardware, `launcher-core` decides what the controls mean for a
//! machine, and the player must not depend on the launcher — the player
//! is the runtime and the launcher the manager that spawns it.
//!
//! What is *here* is the model both must agree on. What stays in
//! `launcher-core` is every choice ADR-014 keeps out of a front end: which
//! setting a family starts on (`bundle::Pad`), and from path C on, which
//! of these bindings a given machine runs with. Nothing in this crate
//! reads a device; `gilrs` belongs to the player alone.
//!
//! Two halves:
//!
//! * `Control` — the *abstract* pad. Every physical pad the host can see
//!   is reported in these terms, so nothing downstream of the player's
//!   `pad.rs` knows what a gilrs button id is, and the same binding
//!   works on an Xbox pad, a DualShock and a 1998 Sidewinder.
//! * `Shaping` and `Binding` — what turns a raw axis into a decision:
//!   the deadzone, the hysteresis that stops an axis held near the
//!   threshold from chattering, and (for `Pad::Keys`) which key each
//!   control presses.
