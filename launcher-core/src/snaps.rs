//! The per-machine snapshot window's model (doc 07, "Snapshots"): which
//! source the list comes from, the in-flight job, and every operation
//! its buttons run.
//!
//! The rules, which are the reason this is one implementation:
//!
//! * A running machine is driven through its monitor (`control.rs`),
//!   because `qemu-img` writing to an image QEMU has open corrupts it,
//!   and even listing wants an image lock QEMU already holds.
//! * A stopped one goes through `qemu-img` (`snapshots.rs`).
//! * Starting or stopping under the window re-reads the list from the
//!   other source.
//! * Live save, load and delete are jobs, not synchronous commands
//!   (saving a 512 MB guest's RAM takes a visible moment), so the window
//!   polls rather than blocking the UI thread on QEMU's main loop.
//! * A load runs on a stopped VM and resumes afterwards only if the
//!   guest was running, so a machine the user had paused stays paused.
//! * `reload` never clears `error`. A failed operation reports and then
//!   re-reads, and a successful re-read must not wipe the report; when
//!   it did, a failed live restore looked like it had worked.
//! * The rows are a tree (`snapshots::Lineage`, the file beside the
//!   bundle): a take records the snapshot the disk descended from, a
//!   restore moves that pointer, and every read reconciles the file
//!   against the disk. `note` says when a snapshot has no record and so
//!   sits at the top level without being a root.
//!
//! The front end still owns when `poll` is called (Qt runs a `Timer`
//! that stops when there is no job) and how a destructive restore is
//! confirmed.
