//! Snapshots (doc 07: "QEMU internal snapshots via in-proc QMP, surfaced
//! in the overlay and the launcher").
//!
//! This is the offline half. A machine that isn't running has no monitor
//! to ask, so the launcher works on the qcow2 directly with `qemu-img`,
//! the same snapshot table QEMU's own `savevm`/`loadvm` use. Listing goes
//! through `qemu-img info --output=json` rather than `snapshot -l`'s
//! column layout: the JSON is a stable interface, while the table is
//! formatted for humans and has no escaping for a tag with a space in it.
//!
//! Restoring is `qemu-img snapshot -a`, which rolls the disk back and
//! leaves the saved CPU/RAM state in the image for a later `loadvm`, the
//! same as a cold boot into a snapshot. Reverting a running machine is
//! the live half (`control.rs`).
//!
//! **The tree is the launcher's own record.** A qcow2 snapshot has an
//! id, a name, a date and a size and nothing about where it came from:
//! restoring one and taking another leaves two snapshots that read as
//! consecutive when they are siblings. So the window writes what it did
//! to `snapshots.toml` beside the bundle (`Lineage`): each snapshot it
//! took with the snapshot the disk was descended from at the time, and
//! which snapshot the disk's present state descends from now, which is
//! where the next one goes. A snapshot with no record — taken by hand
//! with `qemu-img`, or before the launcher kept the file — is a root,
//! and the window says so rather than guess. The file is reconciled
//! against the disk on every read: a record whose snapshot is gone is
//! dropped and its children move up to its parent, which is also what
//! deleting a snapshot in the middle of a branch does to the branch.
//!
//! **Nothing here knows about a toolkit.** The window's model is
//! `snaps.rs`, kept separate so `control.rs` imports nothing that pulls
//! in a toolkit.
