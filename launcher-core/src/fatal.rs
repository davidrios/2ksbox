//! What a windowed program says when it dies.
//!
//! On Windows the launcher is `windows_subsystem = "windows"`
//! (`console.rs` says why), and a windowed process has no stderr. A
//! panic, or a QML engine that fails to load, prints into nothing and the
//! process disappears with no window and no message. The report that
//! comes back is "it didn't start, no error", which names no cause.
//!
//! So this module gives the launcher two outputs that need no toolkit:
//!
//! * A **log** beside the machine library (`launcher.log`, next to the
//!   `player.log` a windowless launcher already writes), appended to,
//!   with a header and a milestone per start-up step. A log that stops
//!   after "data dir" names the step that died.
//! * A **message box** on Windows for the last words, because a user who
//!   double-clicked an icon will not find a log file on their own.
//!
//! The front end calls [`install`] first thing in `main`, so any panic
//! after it is reported. On Unix the log is written too (it costs
//! nothing, and a Flatpak's stderr is just as invisible) and the message
//! box is not compiled.
