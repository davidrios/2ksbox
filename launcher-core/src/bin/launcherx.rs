//! `launcherx`: the launcher's toolkit-free verbs with no front end.
//!
//! Every verb that needs no GUI lives in `launcher_core::cli`, so
//! `launcher-qt` and this binary answer them identically (doc 07,
//! ADR-014). This binary builds with nothing installed, while
//! `launcher-qt` needs Qt 6. `scripts/test.sh` drives the launcher
//! through it for that reason. The suite runs before every commit, on
//! hosts with no Qt, and must not pay for a front end to answer
//! `--print-args`.
//!
//! It is a test and debugging tool. No packager installs it; the shipped
//! command is `2ksbox`, which is `launcher-qt` (ADR-015). It cannot do
//! the headless frame grabs of real windows, which need a toolkit and
//! belong to `launcher-qt` (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, doc 07).

    // No `fatal::install` here, unlike the front end. It exists because a
    // windowed program on Windows has no stderr and a panic on the way to
    // the window would vanish. This is a console program, and installing
    // it would append to the launcher's own crash log 60 times per test
    // run.
