//! Live control of a running machine: media swap and snapshots on a
//! guest that's already up (doc 07's "runtime disc mount/eject/swap from
//! the disc shelf" and "QEMU internal snapshots via in-proc QMP,
//! surfaced in the overlay *and the launcher*").
//!
//! **No new protocol and no player change.** The launcher adds
//! `-qmp unix:<path>,server,nowait` to the arguments it spawns the
//! player with and talks QMP to that socket itself — exactly what
//! `tools/qmpc.py` already does to drive a guest. QEMU allows several
//! monitors, so the player's own in-process one (`player/src/qmp.rs`, on
//! a socketpair with no filesystem path at all) is untouched and neither
//! binary grows an IPC surface of its own. A hand-written bundle run
//! straight through `player` simply has no launcher socket, which is the
//! documented "the launcher is optional" path (doc 07).
//!
//! The monitor is a Unix-domain socket on **every** host, Windows
//! included: QEMU's Windows build binds `unix:` addresses (Windows 10
//! has had AF_UNIX since 1803, and QEMU 9.2 requires newer), so the
//! argument is the same string everywhere and only this end differs —
//! std has no `UnixStream` on Windows, so `imp` there makes the socket
//! through Winsock. Not a loopback port: any local process can reach
//! one, and a QMP monitor is complete control of the machine, where a
//! socket file in the user's own runtime or temp directory is guarded
//! by that directory's permissions on both kinds of host. Not a named
//! pipe either: QEMU's `pipe` chardev on Windows waits for its one
//! client inside machine start-up, so the player would not come up
//! until the launcher connected, and it takes no second connection.
