//! The console a Windows GUI program has, or has not.
//!
//! The front end is a windowed program on Windows
//! (`windows_subsystem = "windows"`), because a console-subsystem binary
//! opens a black terminal window when someone double-clicks it and keeps
//! it for the life of the launcher. That choice costs two things, and
//! this module handles both:
//!
//! * A windowed program started from `cmd.exe` inherits no console, so
//!   `launcher --paths` would print into nowhere. [`attach_parent`]
//!   borrows the console it was launched from.
//! * A windowed program has no console to lend, so every console program
//!   it starts gets a new window of its own: one flash per `qemu-img`
//!   call and a permanent black rectangle behind the player. [`command`]
//!   is how this crate starts a subprocess, and it asks for no console.
//!
//! On every other platform `attach_parent` does nothing and `command` is
//! `Command::new`.
