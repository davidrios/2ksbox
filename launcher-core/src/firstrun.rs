//! The first-run shader offer: the one question a brand-new launcher
//! asks before it shows anything else.
//!
//! Without a preset collection every machine looks like a flat window,
//! and the CRT chain (doc 03) is the point of the player. `shader_source`
//! can fetch libretro's collection, but its download button is two
//! windows deep, on the profile manager's preset row, where someone who
//! has never opened the profile manager will not find it.
//!
//! So this is the same download, asked as a question on the way up and
//! answered once. Two rules make "once" mean once:
//!
//! * The question is asked only when there is **no collection at all**
//!   (`shader_source::presets_dir`). A source checkout has one (the
//!   submodule), and so does any package that ships one.
//! * Answering it either way writes a marker (`first-run.txt` in the
//!   profile directory), so a "no" is not asked again on every start.
//!   The marker sits beside the profiles rather than the presets because
//!   a successful download replaces the preset directory by a rename
//!   (`shader_source::fetch`) and would take the marker with it.
//!
//! When a "yes" finishes, the starter profiles
//! (`shader_source::DEFAULT_PROFILES`) are written against the new
//! collection, so the first machine someone creates has a CRT to pick
//! rather than four hundred `.slangp` files to guess from.
